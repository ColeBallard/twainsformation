The Meditations

By Marcus Aurelius

Translated by George Long

BOOK ONE

From my grandfather Verus, I learned good morals and self-control.

From the reputation and memory of my father, I learned modesty and strength of character.

From my mother, I learned piety, kindness, and the importance of avoiding not only evil deeds but also evil thoughts. I also learned to live a simple life, far from the extravagance of the wealthy.

From my great-grandfather, I learned the value of a private education and the importance of having excellent teachers. I learned that investing in education is crucial.

From my governor, I learned not to engage in partisan politics or get involved in the conflicts of the circus or gladiator fights. I learned the value of hard work, contentment, and minding my own business. I learned not to be swayed by gossip and slander.

From Diognetus, I learned to focus on what truly matters and not to be deceived by charlatans and their claims of magic and exorcism. I learned not to engage in cruel sports like cockfighting and to embrace freedom of speech. I became deeply interested in philosophy and studied under Bacchius, Tandasis, and Marcianus. In my youth, I wrote dialogues and aspired to live a simple, disciplined life in the Greek tradition.

From Rusticus, I learned that my character needed improvement and discipline. He taught me to avoid the pursuit of fame and to abstain from rhetoric, poetry, and ostentatious writing. He taught me to dress appropriately and not to engage in frivolous activities. He taught me to write letters with simplicity, just as he did when writing to my mother from Sinuessa. He also taught me the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation. I learned to read attentively and not to blindly agree with those who speak excessively. I am grateful to him for introducing me to the teachings of Epictetus, which he shared from his personal collection.

From Apollonius, I learned the power of free will and unwavering determination. He taught me to rely solely on reason and to remain steadfast in the face of pain, loss, and illness. He showed me through his own example that one can be both resolute and flexible, never allowing pettiness to interfere with teaching. He taught me that humility is a virtue and that I should appreciate favors from friends without becoming prideful or disregarding them.

From Sextus, a person with a kind disposition, and a family that is governed in a nurturing manner, and the belief in living in harmony with nature; and seriousness without pretense, and the ability to take care of one's friends' interests, and to tolerate ignorant individuals, and those who form opinions without considering the facts: he had the ability to easily adapt to all situations, making interactions with him more enjoyable than any flattery; and at the same time, he was highly respected by those who knew him: he had the talent to both discover and organize, in an intelligent and systematic manner, the principles necessary for life; and he never displayed anger or any other intense emotion, but rather remained calm and affectionate; and he could express approval without making a scene, and he possessed a great deal of knowledge without showing off.

From Alexander the grammarian, I learned to refrain from criticizing others, and not to reproach those who use incorrect or strange language; but instead, to cleverly introduce the correct expression that should have been used, and to use it in the form of an answer or confirmation, or to engage in a discussion about the topic itself, rather than focusing on the word, or by providing some other suitable suggestion.

From Fronto, I learned to recognize envy, deceit, and hypocrisy in a tyrant, and to understand that those among us who are considered influential figures often lack paternal affection.

From Alexander the Platonic, I learned not to frequently or unnecessarily tell others that I am busy, or to constantly use my obligations as an excuse for neglecting my duties towards those I live with; but rather, to prioritize and fulfill those responsibilities.

From Catulus, I learned not to be indifferent when a friend criticizes me, even if the criticism is baseless, but to try to restore them to their usual disposition; and to speak highly of teachers, as is said about Domitius and Athenodotus; and to genuinely love my children.

From my brother Severus, I learned to love my family, truth, and justice; and through him, I became acquainted with Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion, and Brutus; and from him, I received the idea of a society where the same laws apply to everyone, a society governed with equal rights and freedom of speech, and the concept of a monarchy that values the freedom of the people the most; I also learned from him consistency and unwavering dedication to philosophy; and a willingness to do good and readily help others, and to maintain positive expectations, and to believe that my friends love me; and in him, I noticed that he didn't hide his opinions about those he condemned, and his friends didn't need to guess what he wanted or didn't want, because it was clear.

From Maximus, I learned self-control, and not to be swayed by anything; and to maintain a cheerful attitude in all circumstances, including during illness; and to have a balanced moral character that combines kindness and dignity, and to fulfill my obligations without complaining. I observed that everyone believed that he spoke and acted in accordance with his thoughts, and that he never had any malicious intentions; he never showed surprise or haste, and never procrastinated or became confused or dejected, nor did he use laughter to hide his frustration, nor was he prone to anger or suspicion. He was known for his acts of kindness, and he was quick to forgive, and he was always truthful; he appeared as someone who couldn't be swayed from doing what is right, rather than someone who had been improved. I also noticed that no one could ever feel disregarded by Maximus, or dare to think they were better than him. He also had the ability to be humorously entertaining. In my father, I witnessed a calm temperament and unwavering determination in the decisions he made after careful consideration. He did not seek vain glory in what society deems honorable. He had a strong work ethic and perseverance. He was open to listening to those who had ideas for the greater good. He consistently treated each individual according to their merits. He possessed knowledge gained from experience of when to take decisive action and when to show leniency. 

I also noticed that he had overcome any inappropriate desires towards young boys. He considered himself equal to any other citizen and did not impose any obligation on his friends to dine with him or accompany him when he went out. Those who couldn't join him due to urgent matters were always met with understanding. He had a habit of thoroughly researching all matters for deliberation and would persist until he reached the truth, not satisfied with surface appearances. He valued his friendships, never tiring of them or being excessively affectionate. He was content and cheerful in all situations, had foresight, and made provisions for the smallest details without seeking attention. He immediately dismissed any popular praise or flattery. He always remained vigilant in matters necessary for governing the empire, managing expenses, and enduring criticism for his actions. He was neither superstitious nor did he try to win people over with gifts or flattery, nor did he pander to the masses. He exhibited moderation, firmness, and never engaged in base thoughts or actions, nor did he seek novelty. 

He used the resources that contribute to a comfortable life without arrogance or excuses, enjoying them when he had them and not longing for them when he didn't. No one could accuse him of being a sophist, a shallow conformist, or a pedant. Everyone recognized him as a mature, complete man who couldn't be swayed by flattery and was capable of managing his own and others' affairs. He respected true philosophers and didn't criticize those who pretended to be philosophers, nor was he easily influenced by them. He was pleasant in conversation, making himself agreeable without being offensively artificial. He took reasonable care of his physical health, not because he was overly attached to life or concerned with appearance, but so that he rarely needed medical intervention. He graciously acknowledged and supported those who excelled in specific fields such as eloquence, knowledge of the law or ethics, and allowed them to earn the recognition they deserved. He always acted in accordance with the laws of his country without any pretension. 

Furthermore, he was not fond of change or instability, preferring to stay in the same places and engage in familiar activities. After experiencing bouts of headaches, he quickly resumed his regular duties with renewed energy. His secrets were few and only related to public matters. He demonstrated prudence and frugality in organizing public events, constructing public buildings, and making donations to the people. He focused on what needed to be done rather than seeking recognition for his actions. He did not take baths at inappropriate times and had no interest in building extravagant houses or being overly concerned with his diet, the fabric and color of his clothing, or the beauty of his slaves. He dressed simply, often wearing garments from his villa in Lorium or from the town of Lanuvium. We know how he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked for his forgiveness; and that's how he always acted. He wasn't harsh, unforgiving, or violent in any way. He took the time to carefully consider everything, without any confusion, in an orderly, strong, and consistent manner. This reminds me of what was said about Socrates, that he was able to abstain from and enjoy things that many people struggle with. But being strong enough to handle both and remain level-headed is the mark of someone with a perfect and invincible soul, just like he showed during Maximus' illness.

I owe a lot to the gods for blessing me with good grandparents, parents, a sister, teachers, friends, and almost everything else good in my life. I also owe it to the gods that I never gave in to the temptation to offend any of them, even though I had the inclination to do so. But thanks to their favor, I never faced circumstances that put me to the test. I'm also grateful to the gods that I didn't spend too much time with my grandfather's mistress, and that I preserved my youth without indulging in premature experiences of adulthood. Additionally, I'm thankful that I had a ruler and father figure who humbled me and taught me that it's possible to live in a luxurious palace without needing extravagant guards, fancy clothes, or lavish displays. I learned that it's possible to live a modest life without diminishing one's thoughts or actions when it comes to serving the public interest as a ruler. I'm grateful to the gods for giving me a brother who inspired me to be vigilant and who showed me respect and affection. I'm also thankful that my children are intelligent and healthy. I don't regret not pursuing my studies in rhetoric, poetry, and other subjects, even though I could have excelled in them. I quickly honored those who raised me to a position of honor, without postponing it until later, because they were still young at the time. I'm grateful for knowing Apollonius, Rusticus, and Maximus. I received clear and frequent guidance on living in harmony with nature and what that entails. Thanks to the gods and their gifts, help, and inspiration, nothing stopped me from immediately living according to nature. However, I admit that it's my own fault that I still fall short and don't always follow the gods' advice and instructions. I'm grateful that my body has endured this kind of lifestyle for so long. I never succumbed to temptation with Benedicta or Theodotus, and even though I experienced passionate desires, I was able to overcome them. Despite occasionally being annoyed with Rusticus, I never did anything I regretted. Although my mother died young, she spent her final years with me. Whenever I wanted to help someone in need or in any other situation, I never lacked the means to do so. And I've never been in a position where I needed to receive anything from others. I'm fortunate to have such an obedient, affectionate, and simple wife. My children had excellent teachers. I've been shown remedies through dreams, including ones for bloodspitting and dizziness. And so, when I had a desire for philosophy, I didn't seek out any sophists, nor did I waste my time with historians or logical puzzles, or concern myself with studying the stars. All of these things rely on the help of the gods and luck.

Among the Quadi at Granua.

BOOK TWO

Start each morning by reminding yourself that you will encounter busybodies, ungrateful people, arrogant individuals, deceitful souls, and envious and unsociable beings. These things happen to them because they are ignorant of what is good and evil. But I, who have understood that good is beautiful and bad is ugly, and have recognized that those who do wrong are like me, not only in blood or lineage, but also in intelligence and divinity, cannot be harmed by any of them. No one can impose ugliness upon me, and I cannot be angry or hate my fellow human beings. For we are meant to work together, like feet, hands, eyelids, or rows of teeth. Acting against each other is against nature, and it is against nature to be vexed or turn away from one another.

Whatever I am, it is just a small body of flesh and breath, and the ruling part. Put away your books; stop distracting yourself. It is not allowed. Instead, imagine that you are dying and disregard the flesh. It is just blood, bones, nerves, veins, and arteries. Consider the breath as well. It is simply air, constantly being exhaled and inhaled. The third part is the ruling part. Think of yourself as an old man. Don't let this ruling part be a slave anymore, don't let it be controlled like a puppet by unsocial actions. Don't be dissatisfied with your current situation or fearful of the future.

Everything that comes from the gods is guided by Providence. What comes from fortune is not separate from nature, but intertwined and interconnected with the things that Providence has ordered. Everything flows from there, including necessity and what is for the greater good of the whole universe, of which you are a part. But what is good for every part of nature is what the nature of the whole brings, and what serves to maintain this nature. The universe is preserved through the changes of the elements and the changes of things composed of those elements. Let these principles be enough for you, let them be your steadfast beliefs. But let go of the thirst for books, so that you may not die complaining, but instead die cheerfully, truly, and with heartfelt gratitude towards the gods.

Remember how long you have been postponing these things, and how many opportunities the gods have given you, yet you haven't taken advantage of them. Now, finally, realize that you are a part of this universe, and that your existence is a manifestation of the administrator of the universe. Recognize that there is a limited time for you, and if you don't use it to clear the clouds from your mind, it will pass and you will go with it, never to return.

In every moment, think like a Roman and a human being, and approach each task with perfect and simple dignity, affection, freedom, and justice. Free yourself from all other thoughts. And you will free yourself if you live each moment as if it were your last, letting go of carelessness, passionate aversion to reason's commands, hypocrisy, self-love, and discontent with the life that has been given to you. See how few things are needed for a person to live a peaceful life, akin to the existence of the gods. For the gods will not demand anything more from those who follow these principles.

Do wrong to yourself, my soul, do wrong to yourself. But you will no longer have the opportunity to honor yourself. Every person's life is enough. But yours is almost finished, even though your soul does not value itself but finds happiness in the souls of others. Do the external things that come your way distract you? Take time to learn something new and beneficial, and stop being constantly pulled in different directions. But be careful not to be swayed in the opposite direction either. Those who have exhausted themselves with activity in life, yet have no purpose to direct their every movement and thought, are also wasting their time.

People are rarely seen to be unhappy when they do not pay attention to what is happening in someone else's mind. However, those who do not observe their own thoughts and emotions are bound to be unhappy.

Always remember the nature of the whole and your own nature, and how they are interconnected. Understand what role you play in the grand scheme of things and that nothing prevents you from doing and saying things that align with your true nature.

Theophrastus, in his comparison of immoral actions according to common beliefs, states like a true philosopher that offenses committed out of desire are more blameworthy than those committed out of anger. The person who acts out of anger seems to be turning away from reason with pain and unconscious contraction, while the one who offends out of desire appears to be more intemperate and driven by pleasure, behaving in a more feminine manner. Therefore, rightly and philosophically, he claims that offenses committed with pleasure are more blameworthy than those committed with pain. The former resembles someone who has been wronged and is compelled to be angry, whereas the latter is driven by their own impulses and desires.

Since it is possible for you to leave this life at any moment, live and think in accordance with this possibility. But if you were to depart from society, there is no need to fear, for if gods exist, they will not harm you. And if they do not exist or do not care about human affairs, what does it matter to me to live in a universe without gods or without Providence? However, in truth, gods do exist, they do care about human matters, and they have given mankind the means to avoid true evils. And if anything truly evil existed, they would have provided a way for us to avoid it. Therefore, that which does not make us worse cannot make our lives worse. The nature of the universe has not overlooked these things due to ignorance or lack of power or skill. It would not make such a great mistake to let good and evil happen indiscriminately to both the good and the bad. Death, life, honor, dishonor, pain, pleasure - all these things happen equally to both good and bad individuals, and they do not make us better or worse. Therefore, they are neither good nor evil.

How quickly everything disappears - the physical bodies themselves in the universe, and the remembrance of them over time. It is the duty of the intellect to observe the nature of all sensory things, especially those that entice with pleasure, intimidate with pain, or gain attention through fleeting fame. Recognize how worthless, contemptible, sordid, perishable, and lifeless they truly are. Also, observe who holds opinions and voices that give reputation, what death truly is, and that if one looks at it objectively and breaks down all the aspects of death that appear in their imagination, they will realize that it is nothing more than a natural process. And if someone is afraid of a natural process, they are acting like a child. However, this is not just a natural occurrence, but it also contributes to the goals of nature. It is interesting to observe how humans come close to the divine and through which aspect of themselves. Nothing is more unfortunate than a person who meddles in everything, investigates what lies beneath the earth, and speculates about the thoughts of others without realizing that it is enough to pay attention to their inner self and genuinely respect it. Respecting the inner self entails keeping it free from emotions, thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction with what comes from both gods and humans. We should venerate things from the gods for their excellence and cherish things from humans due to our shared kinship. Sometimes, we may even pity others because of their ignorance of good and bad, which is as significant as being unable to differentiate between white and black.

Even if you were to live for three thousand or even ten thousand years, always remember that you do not lose any life other than the one you are currently living, nor do you live any life other than the one you are currently losing. The longest and shortest lives are equal in this regard. The present moment is the same for everyone, although what perishes is not the same. Thus, what is lost seems insignificant. A person cannot lose the past or the future since they do not possess them. Keep these two things in mind: firstly, all things have existed in similar forms for eternity and revolve in a cycle. It makes no difference whether a person witnesses the same things for a hundred years, two hundred years, or an infinite amount of time. Secondly, the person who lives the longest and the person who dies soonest both lose the same amount. The present moment is the only thing a person can be deprived of, assuming that it is the only thing they possess. If they do not possess something, it cannot be taken away from them.

Remember that everything is a matter of perspective. The statement made by the Cynic philosopher Monimus is evident, and its usefulness becomes apparent if one extracts the truth from it.

The soul of a person causes harm to itself in several ways. Firstly, when it becomes distressed and separates itself from nature, which encompasses the essence of all other things. Secondly, when it turns away from or intends to harm others, like those who are angry. Thirdly, when it is overwhelmed by pleasure or pain. Fourthly, when it acts or speaks insincerely and dishonestly. Fifthly, when it allows its actions and movements to lack purpose, acting thoughtlessly and without considering their nature. Even the smallest actions should be done with a goal in mind. The purpose of rational beings is to follow reason and the principles of the oldest city and society.

In human life, time is fleeting, the body is subject to decay, perception is dull, and the composition of the body is in constant flux. The soul is transient, fortune is unpredictable, and fame lacks judgment. In short, everything related to the body is transient, while everything related to the soul is ephemeral. Life is a constant battle and a temporary stay in a foreign land, and after death, fame fades into oblivion. So, what can guide a person in life? There is only one thing: philosophy. But the key is to keep the inner spirit of a person peaceful and unharmed, superior to both pleasure and pain. One must live with purpose, without hypocrisy, not relying on others for their own actions. Accepting everything that happens as part of their own journey, and embracing death with a positive mindset, knowing that it is just the natural dissolution of the elements that make up all living beings. And if there is no harm in the continuous change and transformation of these elements, why should one fear the change and dissolution of everything? After all, anything that is in accordance with nature cannot be considered evil.

In Carnuntum.

BOOK THREE

We should not only recognize that our life is gradually fading away and that only a small portion of it remains, but we must also consider another factor: if we were to live longer, there is no guarantee that our understanding would still be sufficient to comprehend things and retain the ability to contemplate and acquire knowledge of the divine and human. As we age, our bodily functions like perspiration, nutrition, imagination, and appetite may continue, but the ability to utilize our faculties, fulfill our responsibilities, objectively evaluate appearances, and determine whether it is time to depart from life, all of these require a disciplined mind, which diminishes with time. Therefore, we must hurry, not only because death is approaching day by day, but also because our capacity to understand and perceive things fades even before our physical demise.

We should also take note that even the things that follow the natural order of events contain elements that are pleasing and captivating. For instance, when bread is baked, some parts split on the surface, and these openings, though contrary to the baker's intention, possess a unique beauty that arouses a desire to eat. Likewise, ripe figs naturally split open, and the near-rottenness of mature olives adds a certain charm to the fruit. The bending ears of corn, the eyebrows of a lion, the foam that flows from the mouth of a wild boar, and many other things, although individually they may not be considered beautiful upon closer examination, when viewed in the context of the natural world, they contribute to its adornment and please the mind. If one develops a deeper understanding and appreciation for the workings of the universe, almost every consequence that follows will seem to have been arranged in a way that brings pleasure. Thus, even the gaping jaws of wild beasts can be seen with the same enjoyment as those portrayed by artists, and an old man or woman can exhibit a certain maturity and grace. True purity of sight allows one to appreciate the attractive beauty of young individuals without lustful intentions. These and many other things may not appeal to everyone, but to those who have truly become acquainted with nature and her creations.

Hippocrates, after curing numerous diseases, fell ill and died. The Chaldeans predicted the deaths of many, only to meet their own fate. Alexander, Pompey, and Julius Caesar, despite their conquests and the slaughter of countless soldiers and citizens, eventually met their own demise. Heraclitus, who pondered the concept of the universe's destruction, died from internal water retention, covered in mud. Democritus was destroyed by lice, and Socrates was killed by other lice. What does all this mean? You've started, you've made the journey, you've reached the destination; now get out. If indeed there is another life, there is no shortage of gods, not even there. But if it is a state without sensation, you will no longer be bound by pain and pleasure, and you will no longer be a slave to the body, which is far inferior to the mind: for the mind is intelligence and divinity, while the body is earthly and corrupt.

Do not waste the rest of your life thinking about others when you don't direct your thoughts towards something useful. By having such thoughts as "What is that person doing, and why, and what are they saying, and what are they thinking, and what are they planning," we miss the opportunity to do something else. We should refrain from indulging in thoughts that serve no purpose, especially ones driven by curiosity or malice. Instead, we should train ourselves to think only about things that, if someone were to ask us what we are thinking about, we could openly answer. Our thoughts should reflect simplicity, benevolence, and what is appropriate for a social being who cares not for pleasure or sensual enjoyment, and who has no room for jealousy, suspicion, or anything else that would bring embarrassment if revealed. A person who embodies these qualities and no longer hesitates to align themselves with the best is like a priest and servant of the gods. They also utilize the divine spark within them, which allows them to remain unaffected by pleasure, unhurt by pain, untouched by insults, and unmoved by injustice. They are dedicated to the noblest cause, incapable of being overpowered by any passion, deeply committed to justice, and fully accepting of everything that happens to them. They don't often, unless absolutely necessary and for the greater good, concern themselves with what others say, do, or think. They focus solely on their own actions, striving to make them honorable. They firmly believe that their own portion is good and that the lot assigned to each person carries them along with it. They also remember that every rational being is their kin and that caring for all humans is a natural inclination. They hold on to the opinions not of everyone, but only those who unquestionably live in accordance with nature. As for those who do not, they constantly remind themselves of the kind of people they are both in public and in private, day and night, and with whom they engage in impure activities. Consequently, they do not value the praise that comes from such individuals, as they are not even satisfied with themselves.

Do not engage in labor reluctantly or without considering the common good. Approach your work with focus and without distraction. Do not let unnecessary embellishment adorn your thoughts. Do not be excessively talkative or busy with too many things. Furthermore, let the divine spark within you protect you as a mature individual engaged in political affairs, as a Roman, and as a leader who has assumed their position with the readiness to depart from life, needing neither an oath nor anyone's testimony. Be cheerful and do not seek external aid or the tranquility that others provide. You must stand upright on your own, not relying on others to keep you upright. If you find anything in life better than justice, truth, self-control, courage, and, in short, anything better than finding satisfaction in doing what is right and accepting your assigned circumstances without complaint, then pursue it wholeheartedly and enjoy the best that you have found. However, if nothing surpasses the divine nature within you, which governs your desires and evaluates your thoughts, detached from the influence of the senses and devoted to the gods and humanity, if you find everything else to be inferior and of lesser value, then do not give in to anything else. For if you stray from this path, you will no longer be able to prioritize and pursue your true possession and purpose without distractions. It is not appropriate for anything of a different nature, such as praise from the masses, power, or indulgence in pleasure, to compete with what is truly rational, moral, and practical. Even though these things may seem to align with the better things to some extent, they quickly take precedence and lead us astray. Therefore, I advise you to simply and freely choose what is better and stick to it.

However, if something is useful to you as a rational being, then hold onto it. But if it is only useful to you as an animal, acknowledge it as such and maintain your judgement without arrogance. Just make sure to approach this inquiry with certainty.

Never consider anything beneficial to yourself if it requires you to break your promises, lose your self-respect, hate anyone, be suspicious, curse, act hypocritically, or desire anything that requires walls and curtains. For someone who prioritizes intelligence, their guiding spirit, and the worship of excellence, there is no need for a tragic role, no need for moaning, and no need for solitude or excessive company. Most importantly, they will live without either pursuing or fleeing from death. Whether they have their soul enclosed in their body for a longer or shorter period of time, it matters not to them. Even if they must depart immediately, they will go as willingly as if they were doing any other task with dignity and order. Their only concern throughout life is to not lose sight of anything that pertains to an intelligent being and a member of a civilized community.

In the mind of someone who is disciplined and purified, you will find no corrupt thoughts, impurities, or festering wounds. Nor is their life incomplete when fate catches up with them, as if they left the stage before finishing the play. Moreover, they possess neither servility nor affectation, neither excessive attachment nor detachment from external matters. They are free from blame and have nothing to hide.

Respect the faculty that forms opinions. It is this faculty that determines whether your ruling mind will hold opinions that go against nature and the nature of a rational being. This faculty promises freedom from hasty judgments, friendship towards others, and obedience to the gods.

Therefore, discard all unnecessary things and focus only on what is essential. Also, remember that every person only lives in the present moment, which is an indivisible point, and that the rest of their life is either in the past or uncertain. The time that each individual lives is short, the portion of the earth they inhabit is small, and even the longest-lasting posthumous fame is fleeting, sustained only by a succession of insignificant human beings who will soon die and who have no true understanding of themselves, let alone those who passed away long ago. To the aids that have been mentioned, let's add one more: Create a clear definition or description of the thing presented to you so that you can fully understand its essence, its true nature, and its composition. Give it a proper name and identify the elements it is composed of and will eventually break down into. There is nothing more enlightening than being able to systematically and truthfully examine every object that life presents to you, always considering its place in the universe, its purpose, its value in relation to the whole, and its significance to humanity. Remember that as a citizen of the highest city, all other cities being like families, you must understand what each thing is, what it is made of, how long it will last, and what virtues you need to cultivate in relation to it – such as kindness, courage, honesty, loyalty, simplicity, contentment, and more. Therefore, in every situation, acknowledge that some things come from God, others are determined by fate and chance, and still others are influenced by people who are part of the same human race but unknowingly act against their own nature. However, you know better, and for this reason, you should treat them with kindness and justice, following the natural law of fellowship. At the same time, in matters of indifference, strive to determine their true value. If you diligently work on what is in front of you, guided by reason, with focus, determination, and a clear mind, without allowing distractions, and keeping your divine nature pure, as if you were obligated to return it immediately, if you live in the present moment, not expecting or fearing anything else, but satisfied with your current actions in accordance with nature, and if you speak and act with honesty and integrity, you will live a happy life. And no one can prevent this. Just as physicians always have their instruments and knives ready for emergencies, you should have principles ready to understand both divine and human matters and to approach everything, even the smallest tasks, with the awareness of the connection between the divine and human realms. For you cannot do anything well that concerns humans without considering the divine, and vice versa. Don't wander aimlessly anymore. Don't delay reading your own memoirs or the writings of the ancient Romans and Greeks that you have saved for your old age. Instead, hurry towards the end that lies ahead of you, abandon futile hopes, and take control of your own life while you still have the power to do so. They don't know how many things are implied by the words stealing, sowing, buying, keeping quiet, and knowing what needs to be done. These things are not understood solely by the eyes, but through a different kind of perception. Body, soul, intelligence: Sensations belong to the body, desires belong to the soul, and principles belong to the intelligence. Animals can also perceive forms through appearances, and both wild beasts and men who have emasculated themselves, like Phalaris and Nero, are driven by the strings of desire. Having the intelligence to discern what is appropriate is also present in those who don't believe in gods, betray their country, and commit impure acts behind closed doors. If everything else I have mentioned is common to all, then there remains something unique to the good person: the ability to be pleased and content with what happens, to accept the circumstances that unfold, and to not tarnish the divinity within them with a multitude of distractions. They preserve their tranquility, obediently following their inner divinity like a god, never speaking or acting against truth or justice. Even if others refuse to believe that they live a simple, modest, and contented life, they do not become angry or stray from the path that leads to the end of life. They aim to arrive at the end of life pure, tranquil, ready to depart, and fully at peace with their fate.

Book Four: That which rules within, when it aligns with nature, easily adapts to the events that occur. It requires no specific material, but moves towards its purpose under certain conditions. It even uses opposition to fuel its progress, much like fire consumes what falls into it, growing stronger as it consumes more. Therefore, let no action be done without purpose, and always adhere to the principles of art.

Many people seek retreats in the countryside, by the sea, or in the mountains. You too may desire such things. However, this desire is common and ordinary. True retreat lies within yourself, where you can find the utmost peace and tranquility. Look within and contemplate thoughts that bring you immediate tranquility. Remember, tranquility is simply the harmonious state of the mind. Make a habit of retreating into yourself and renewing your spirit. Keep your principles concise and fundamental. When you return to them, they will cleanse your soul and free you from discontentment with the external world. What is there to be discontented about? The flaws of humanity? Remember, rational beings exist for one another, and endurance is a part of justice. People do wrong unintentionally. Consider how many have perished due to mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting, reduced to nothing but ashes. Finally, find peace.

Perhaps you are dissatisfied with your place in the universe. Remember two possibilities: either there is a providence guiding everything or it is all a result of random atoms colliding. Alternatively, recall the arguments that support the idea that the world is a political community. Find peace.

If earthly concerns still trouble you, remember that the mind is unaffected by the breath, whether it moves gently or violently. Once you separate yourself and recognize your own power, you will realize that physical sensations do not affect the mind. Consider all you have learned about pain and pleasure and find peace.

And if the desire for fame torments you, reflect on how quickly everything is forgotten. Consider the vastness of time and the emptiness of applause. Remember the fickleness and lack of judgment in those who give praise. See the limitations and narrowness of the space in which fame exists. Find peace. Remember, the entire earth is just a tiny point, and your dwelling is a minuscule corner of it. There are only a few people in this world, and their opinions should not define your worth. Here's the modern style transformation:

So here's the deal: Remember to take time for yourself and don't overwhelm or stress yourself out. Be free and look at things from a human perspective, as a citizen, as someone who will eventually die. But among the things that are easily accessible to you, focus on these two. First, remember that external things don't affect your soul; it's only our internal opinions that cause disturbances. Second, keep in mind that everything you see is constantly changing and won't last forever. Remember how many changes you've already witnessed. The universe is always transforming, and life is all about perspective.

If our intellectual part is common, then our reason, which makes us rational beings, is also common. If that's the case, then the common reason also guides us on what to do and what not to do. And if that's true, there must be a common law. And if there's a common law, then we are all fellow citizens. And if that's the case, we are all members of some political community. And if that's true, then the world is like a state. Because what other political community can claim that the entire human race is its members? And from this common political community, our intellectual and reasoning abilities, as well as our capacity for law, also come. So just as our physical body is made up of different elements, our intellectual part also comes from a source.

Death is just like birth, a natural mystery. It's a combination of the same elements and a decomposition into the same. There's nothing to be ashamed of, as it's not against the nature of a rational being or the reason of our existence.

It's only natural for certain people to do certain things; it's a matter of necessity. And if someone doesn't accept that, it's like not allowing a fig tree to produce fruit. But always remember that both you and that person will be dead very soon, and soon, even your names won't be remembered.

If you remove your opinion, then you remove the complaint of being harmed. And if you remove the complaint, then the harm is gone too. Anything that doesn't make you worse doesn't make your life worse either, and it doesn't harm you externally or internally. This is the nature of what is universally beneficial, and it's unavoidable.

Remember that everything that happens, happens justly. If you observe closely, you'll see that it's true. I'm not just talking about the continuity of events but also about what is fair, as if someone is assigning value to each thing. So keep going as you've started, and whatever you do, do it with the intention of being good and in a way that aligns with what it means to be a good person. Stick to this in every action.

Don't have the same opinion as someone who wrongs you or wants you to have that opinion. Look at things as they truly are. Always have these two rules ready: first, only do what reason suggests is for the benefit of humanity, and second, be open to changing your opinion if someone can convince you with valid reasons, not just because it's pleasant or brings you reputation.

Do you have reason? I do. So why aren't you using it? Because if reason does its job, what more do you want?

You existed as a part, and you will disappear into the same source that created you, but you will be transformed and absorbed back into it. In modern style:

There are many things happening around us, but they don't really matter. In just a short amount of time, if you stick to your principles and reason, people will see you as a god instead of an animal or fool. Don't act like you have forever to live. Death is always looming over you. While you're alive and have the power to do so, be good. 

You can avoid a lot of trouble by not worrying about what others say, do, or think. Instead, focus on your own actions and make sure they are just and pure. As Agathon said, don't pay attention to the immoral behavior of others, but stay on the right path without deviating from it. 

Those who desire fame after death fail to realize that everyone who remembers them will also die soon. And even those who come after them will die eventually, until no one remembers them anymore. But even if those who remember were immortal, what does it matter to you? And I'm not just talking about the dead, but also the living. What's the point of praise unless it serves a purpose? By rejecting the gift of nature and seeking praise, you're clinging to something unnecessary.

Anything that is beautiful is beautiful in itself and doesn't need praise to be so. Praise doesn't make something better or worse. This applies to things that are considered beautiful by society as well, like material possessions and artwork. True beauty doesn't depend on praise, just like law, truth, benevolence, or modesty. Does an emerald become worse if it's not praised? Or gold, ivory, purple, a musical instrument, a knife, a flower, or a shrub?

If souls continue to exist, how does the air hold them for eternity? But then, how does the earth hold the bodies of those who have been buried for so long? Just like the bodies in the earth change and make way for new bodies, souls that are removed into the air also transform and make room for new souls. They become part of the universal intelligence and take on a fiery nature. This is one possible explanation if souls continue to exist. But we shouldn't only think about the bodies buried in the earth, but also the animals that are consumed by us and other animals every day. The earth receives them through the transformation of their bodies into blood and their conversion into the elements of air or fire.

What's the truth in all of this? It's the distinction between the material and the cause of form, the formal aspect.

Don't get carried away by external influences. In every action, remember to uphold justice and maintain your ability to understand.

Everything that aligns with the universe aligns with me. Nothing is too early or too late for me if it's in accordance with the natural order. Everything that the seasons bring is beneficial to me, for everything comes from nature, exists within nature, and returns to nature. The poet might say, "Dear city of Cecrops," but can't we say, "Dear city of Zeus"?

The philosopher advises us to focus on a few things in order to find tranquility. But perhaps it's better to do what is necessary and what is required by our inherently social nature. This not only brings the tranquility that comes from doing good, but also the tranquility that comes from doing fewer things. Most of what we say and do is unnecessary. If we remove these unnecessary things, we will have more free time and less discomfort. So, on every occasion, we should ask ourselves, "Is this necessary?" We should not only remove unnecessary actions, but also unnecessary thoughts, because unnecessary thoughts lead to unnecessary actions.

Try living like a good person who is satisfied with their own portion in life, and content with their own just actions and kind nature. Have you seen those things? Look at them. Don't let them disturb you. Keep things simple. If someone does wrong, they are only hurting themselves. If something happens to you, remember that everything that happens is a part of the universe and has been allotted to you. In short, life is short. Use reason and justice to make the most of the present moment.

Be moderate in your leisure activities.

The universe is either well-organized or chaotic, but it is still a universe. Can order exist within you if there is disorder in the universe? Especially when everything is separated, diffused, and connected. 

A person with a negative character, a weak character, a stubborn character, a beastly character, a childish character, an ignorant character, a fake character, a vulgar character, a deceitful character, a tyrannical character. 

If someone doesn't know what is happening in the world, they are as much a stranger as someone who doesn't know what is in the world. They are running away from rationality, they are blind to understanding, and they are dependent on others without possessing the necessary tools for life. They are a burden on society, separating themselves from the reason of our shared human nature because they are unhappy with what happens. But it is this same nature that produced them. They are tearing themselves away from the collective soul of rational beings, becoming isolated from the state. 

One person is a philosopher without a robe, and another is a philosopher without a book. Here is another person who is half-naked, saying, "I don't have bread, but I rely on reason." And I don't gain a livelihood from my knowledge, but I rely on reason.

Love the art you have learned, no matter how humble it may be. Be content with it and live the rest of your life as if you have entrusted everything to the gods, not allowing yourself to become a tyrant or a slave to anyone.

Consider the times of Vespasian, and you will see people getting married, raising children, getting sick, dying, fighting, feasting, trading, farming, flattering, being stubbornly arrogant, suspecting, plotting, wishing for others to die, complaining about the present, loving, accumulating wealth, desiring power. But that life no longer exists. Now consider the times of Trajan, and it is the same. Their lives have also come to an end. Look at other periods of time and whole nations, and see how many great efforts have ultimately led to their downfall and dissolution. But most importantly, think about those people you have known who wasted their lives on trivial things, neglecting what was truly important and failing to appreciate and be content with what they had. And remember that not everything deserves our attention and focus. By understanding this, we can avoid dissatisfaction by not wasting our energy on insignificant matters.

The words we used before are now outdated, just like the names of famous people from the past. Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Leonnatus, Scipio, Cato, Augustus, Hadrian, and Antoninus. Everything eventually fades away and becomes forgotten. And I say this even about those who achieved great things. In modern style:

Once people exhale their last breath, they are forgotten and no one speaks of them. And really, what is the significance of eternal remembrance? It's essentially meaningless. So, what should we focus our efforts on? The answer is simple: having just thoughts, engaging in social actions, speaking truthfully, and having a mindset that accepts everything that happens as necessary and normal, stemming from the same source.

Embrace Clotho, one of the Fates, and allow her to weave your destiny however she pleases. Everything in life is temporary, including both the things we remember and the things that are remembered.

Always remember that change is inevitable and embrace the fact that the universe loves to transform existing things into new ones. Everything that exists is the seed for what will come next. But don't limit your thinking to literal seeds planted in the ground or a womb; that's a narrow-minded perspective.

You will die soon, and yet you are not yet free from disturbances, suspicion of harm from external things, or a genuine kindness towards all. You still haven't fully understood that wisdom lies in acting justly.

Take a look at the guiding principles of people, even those who are considered wise. See what they avoid and what they pursue.

What you consider evil does not reside in another person's guiding principle, nor in the constant change of your physical body. So where does it exist? It lies in the part of you that forms opinions about what is evil. Therefore, choose not to form such opinions, and all will be well. Even if the physical body closest to this part is burned, filled with matter, and decaying, let the part that forms opinions about these things remain calm. Let it judge that nothing is inherently good or bad if it can happen to both the virtuous and the wicked. Something that affects both those who live against nature and those who live in accordance with nature is neither natural nor unnatural.

Always view the universe as a single living being with one substance and one soul. Notice how everything is interconnected and contributes to the perception of this living being. Observe how all things work together and are the causes of everything that exists. Pay attention to the continuous flow of events and the interconnectedness of everything.

You are a small soul carrying around a body, as Epictetus used to say.

It is not a bad thing for things to change, nor is it good for things to remain the same due to change.

Time is like a powerful river made up of events. As soon as one thing is observed, it is swept away, and something new takes its place. Everything that happens is as familiar as the blossoming of roses in spring and the ripening of fruit in summer. Disease, death, slander, and betrayal are all part of life and are known to everyone.

In the grand scheme of things, each event is connected to what came before it. This is not just a random list of unrelated events; there is a rational connection between them. Just as all existing things are harmoniously arranged, the things that come into existence are not simply a sequence but rather a remarkable relationship.

Always remember the words of Heraclitus: the death of earth is to become water, the death of water is to become air, and the death of air is to become fire, and vice versa. And think also of those who forget where the path leads and constantly quarrel with the reason that governs the universe, the very thing they are in constant communion with. They find the things they encounter daily to be strange. We should not act and speak as if we were asleep, for even in sleep we still seem to act and speak. We should not simply act and speak as we have been taught, like children learning from their parents.

If a god were to tell you that you will die tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, you wouldn't care much whether it was on the third day or tomorrow, unless you were incredibly cowardly - because the difference is so small. So, it should not be a great concern to die after many years, as many as you can count, rather than tomorrow.

Continuously reflect on how many physicians have died after furrowing their brows over the sick, how many astrologers have died after confidently predicting the deaths of others, how many philosophers have died after endless discussions about death or immortality, how many heroes have died after killing thousands, and how many tyrants, who acted with terrible insolence as if they were immortal, have died after wielding power over others' lives. Think also about the cities that are now completely dead, such as Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and countless others. Include in your calculations all the people you have known, one after another. One person buries another, and then they themselves are laid out dead. All of this happens in a short amount of time. In conclusion, always observe how short-lived and worthless human things are. What was a little mucus yesterday will become a mummy or ashes tomorrow. Pass through this short span of time in accordance with nature and end your journey contently, just like an olive falls off when it is ripe. Bless nature for producing you and thank the tree on which you grew.

Be like the promontory against which the waves constantly crash, but it remains firm and tames the furious water around it.

"I am unhappy because this has happened to me." - Not so, but "I am happy, though this has happened to me," because I remain free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future. Such a thing could have happened to anyone, but not everyone would have remained free from pain in such a situation. So why is this considered a misfortune rather than a good fortune? And do you consider anything a deviation from human nature if it is not contrary to the will of human nature? Well, you know the will of nature. Will this event prevent you from being just, magnanimous, temperate, prudent, secure against hasty opinions and falsehoods? Will it prevent you from having modesty, freedom, and everything else that allows human nature to fulfill itself? Remember, on every occasion that causes you distress, apply this principle: it is not a misfortune, but it is good fortune to bear it nobly.

To help cultivate contempt for death, it is a common but still useful practice to consider those who have clung to life tenaciously. What have they gained more than those who died early? They eventually end up in their tombs, whether it's Cadicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, or anyone else like them who have carried many to their graves and then were carried out themselves. The time between birth and death is short; consider how much trouble is endured during this interval, in the company of what kind of people, and in a frail body. Therefore, do not consider life to be of great value. Look at the vastness of time behind you and the boundless time ahead of you. In this infinity, what is the difference between someone who lives for three days and someone who lives for three generations? Always choose the shortest path, which is the natural one. Therefore, say and do everything in accordance with sound reason. For such a purpose, it liberates a person from trouble, warfare, and all pretentiousness and ostentatious display.

BOOK FIVE

In the morning when you wake up unwillingly, keep this thought in mind - I am rising to fulfill my duties as a human being. So why should I be dissatisfied if I am going to do the things I exist for and the reason I was brought into this world? Or was I made just to lie in bed and keep myself warm? - But that is more pleasant. - Do you exist then just to seek pleasure, and not for action or exertion? Don't you see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees working together to organize their respective parts of the universe? And yet you are unwilling to do the work of a human being, and you don't hurry to do what is in line with your nature? - But it is necessary to rest as well. - It is necessary, but nature has set limits to that too. She has set limits to eating and drinking, and yet you go beyond those limits, beyond what is sufficient. But in your actions, it is not the same. You stop short of what you can do. So, you don't truly love yourself, because if you did, you would love your nature and its desires. But those who love their respective arts exhaust themselves working on them without rest or food. Yet you value your own nature less than a turner values the art of turning, or a dancer values the art of dancing, or a lover of money values his money, or a vain person values their little glory. And such people, when they have a strong affection for something, choose not to eat or sleep rather than neglecting the things they care about. But do you consider the actions that concern society to be more vile and less worthy of your labor? 

How easy it is to repel and dismiss every troublesome or unsuitable impression and immediately be in tranquility. Consider every word and deed that aligns with nature to be appropriate for you. Don't be swayed by the criticism or words of others. If something is good to be done or said, don't consider it beneath you. Those individuals have their own guiding principles and follow their own path. Don't concern yourself with that. Just keep going, following your own nature and the common nature, for they go hand in hand.

I go through the things that happen naturally until I fall and rest, exhaling my breath into the same element from which I inhale it daily, and returning to the earth from which my father gathered the seed, my mother the blood, and my nurse the milk. The earth that has provided me with food and drink for so many years. The earth that supports me when I walk on it and use it for various purposes.

You say, "People cannot admire the sharpness of your wit." - Fine, but there are many other things that you cannot say, "I am not naturally inclined towards them." Show those qualities that are completely within your power: sincerity, seriousness, endurance of labor, aversion to pleasure, contentment with what you have and with few things, benevolence, honesty, lack of desire for excess, freedom from frivolity, and magnanimity. Don't you see how many qualities you can immediately exhibit, for which you have no excuse of natural incapacity or unsuitability, and yet you willingly fall short of them? Or are you compelled, because of your deficiencies in nature, to complain, be stingy, flatter, criticize your own body, try to please others, make a grand show, and be restless in your mind? No, by the gods, you could have freed yourself from these things long ago. Only if you can truly be accused of being slow and dull-witted, then you must make an effort to improve, not neglecting it or taking pleasure in your dullness.

One person, when they have done a favor for another, is quick to consider it as a credit to themselves. Another person is not ready to do this, but still in his own mind he thinks of the man as his debtor, and he knows what he has done. A third person does not even know what he has done, but he is like a vine that has produced grapes and seeks nothing more after it has once produced its proper fruit. Like a horse that has run, a dog that has tracked game, or a bee that has made honey, a man, when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he moves on to another act, just as a vine goes on to produce grapes again in season.

- So, must a man then be one of these who act in this way without observing it?
- Yes.

But it is necessary to observe what a man is doing. It is characteristic of the social animal to perceive that he is working in a social manner and to wish that his social partner also perceives it. What you say is true, but you do not understand what is being said. For this reason, you will become one of those whom I spoke of before, because even they are misled by a certain show of reason. But if you choose to understand the meaning of what is said, do not fear that you will omit any social act.

A prayer of the Athenians: Rain, rain, dear Zeus, down on the plowed fields of the Athenians and on the plains.

- In truth, we ought not to pray at all, or we ought to pray in this simple and noble fashion. Just as we must understand when it is said that Aesculapius prescribed horse-exercise, bathing in cold water, or going without shoes to this man, we must also understand it when it is said that the nature of the universe prescribed disease, mutilation, loss, or anything else of the kind to this man. In the first case, "prescribed" means something like this: he prescribed this for this man as a thing adapted to procure health. And in the second case, it means: That which happens to every man is fixed in a manner for him suitably to his destiny. This is what we mean when we say that things are suitable to us, like when workmen say that squared stones in walls or the pyramids are suitable when they fit them to one another in some kind of connection. There is one overall fitness, harmony. And as the universe is made up of all bodies to be such a body as it is, so out of all existing causes, necessity (destiny) is made up to be such a cause as it is. Even those who are completely ignorant understand what I mean, for they say, "It (necessity, destiny) brought this to such a person." This was brought and this was prescribed to him. Let us then receive these things, as well as those which Aesculapius prescribes. Many of his prescriptions are disagreeable, but we accept them in the hope of health. Let the perfecting and accomplishment of the things that the common nature judges to be good be judged by you to be of the same kind as your health. And so, accept everything that happens, even if it seems disagreeable, because it leads to the health of the universe and to the prosperity and happiness of Zeus (the universe). For he would not have brought on any man what he has brought if it were not useful for the whole. The nature of anything does not cause anything that is not suitable to what is directed by it. There are two reasons why it is right to be content with what happens to you: one, because it was done for you and prescribed for you, and in a way had reference to you originally from the most ancient causes spun with your destiny; and the other, because even what comes to every man individually is, to the power that administers the universe, a cause of happiness, perfection, and even its very continuation. For the integrity of the whole is mutilated if you cut off anything from the conjunction and the continuity of the parts or causes. And you do cut off, as far as it is in your power, when you are dissatisfied and try to put anything out of the way. Do not be disgusted, discouraged, or dissatisfied if you do not succeed in doing everything according to the right principles. Instead, when you fail, try again and be content if most of what you do aligns with human nature and the things you love. Do not approach philosophy as a master, but rather like someone with sore eyes who applies a bit of sponge and egg, or like someone who applies a plaster or drenches with water. By doing so, you will not fail to obey reason and you will find peace in it. Remember that philosophy only requires what your nature requires, but you desire something that goes against nature.

One might object and ask, "What could be more enjoyable than what I am doing?" But isn't this the very reason why pleasure deceives us? Consider if qualities like magnanimity, freedom, simplicity, equanimity, and piety are not more enjoyable. What could be more enjoyable than wisdom itself when you think of the security and happiness that come from understanding and knowledge?

Things are so complex that they have seemed unintelligible to philosophers, even to the Stoics themselves. Our beliefs are constantly changing because who never changes? So, focus your thoughts on the objects themselves and consider how short-lived and worthless they are. They may end up in the possession of someone vile, a prostitute, or a thief. Then turn your attention to the morals of those who live with you. It's hardly possible to endure even the most agreeable of them, let alone endure yourself. In such darkness, filth, and constant change of substance, time, motion, and things moved, I cannot imagine anything worth highly valuing or pursuing seriously. On the contrary, it is our duty to find comfort and wait for natural dissolution without being upset by the delay. Rest only in these principles: first, nothing will happen to me that goes against the nature of the universe, and second, I have the power to never act contrary to my god and inner voice. No one can force me to do otherwise.

I must ask myself, what am I using my soul for? On every occasion, I must inquire, what is the ruling principle in this part of me? Whose soul do I possess? Is it that of a child, a young man, a weak woman, a tyrant, a domestic animal, or a wild beast?

We can learn about the things that appear good to the majority by observing this. If someone genuinely considered prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude as truly good, they would not entertain anything that goes against what is truly good. However, if someone first believes that the things which appear good to the majority are truly good, they will readily accept and find the words of a comic writer applicable. This shows that even the majority can perceive the difference. Otherwise, this saying would not offend or be rejected in the first case, while we accept it when it is said about wealth and the means that promote luxury and fame, considering it fitting and witty. Keep going and ask yourself if we should value and consider those things good to which the words of the comic writer can be aptly applied after conceiving them in our minds initially - that someone who possesses them in abundance does not even have a place to relieve themselves.

I am made up of form and matter, and neither will perish into non-existence as neither came from non-existence. Every part of me will eventually transform into some part of the universe, which will then change into another part, and so on for eternity. And as a result of such a change, I exist, as do those who created me, and so on indefinitely in the opposite direction. We can say this without any hindrance, even if the universe is governed by definite periods of revolution. Reason and philosophy are powerful forces that are self-sufficient and capable of accomplishing their own tasks. They start from their own first principle and progress towards their intended end. This is why these actions are called correct or right actions, as they follow the correct path.

Anything that does not belong to a person as a human being should not be considered theirs. These things are not necessary for a person, nor does human nature promise them, nor are they the means by which human nature achieves its purpose. Therefore, the purpose of a person does not lie in these things, nor does the fulfillment of this purpose depend on them. What aids in achieving this purpose is what is good. Furthermore, if any of these things did belong to a person, it would not be right for them to despise or oppose them. A person who shows that they do not need these things would not be deserving of praise, nor would someone who willingly deprives themselves of them be considered good, if indeed these things were truly good. However, the more a person deprives themselves of these things, or similar things, or even when they are deprived of them, the more patiently they endure the loss, the better person they become.

The character of your mind will reflect your habitual thoughts, as the soul is influenced by thoughts. Therefore, fill your mind with a continuous series of thoughts such as these: for example, wherever a person can live, they can also live well. If they can live in a palace, then they can also live well in a palace. Also, consider that everything has been created for a specific purpose, and it is directed towards that purpose. The advantage and good of each thing lies in its end. Now, for a rational being, society is good, as it has been previously demonstrated that we are made for society. Isn't it evident that the inferior exists for the sake of the superior? Living beings are superior to non-living beings, and among living beings, those with reason are the superior ones.

To pursue what is impossible is madness, and it is impossible for the bad to not engage in such behavior.

Nothing happens to a person that nature has not equipped them to endure. The same things happen to others, and whether they do not perceive them or show resilience, they remain unharmed. It is shameful that ignorance and arrogance are stronger than wisdom.

Things themselves do not affect the soul in any way, nor do they have access to the soul or the ability to influence or move it. The soul alone has the power to turn and move itself, and it determines the judgments it deems appropriate based on the things presented to it.

In one aspect, humanity is closest to me, as I must do good to and endure other people. But when certain individuals become obstacles to my proper actions, they become indifferent to me, just like the sun, wind, or a wild animal. It is true that these things may hinder my actions, but they do not impede my emotions and disposition, which have the ability to act conditionally and adapt. The mind converts and transforms every hindrance into an aid for its activity. Thus, what may be an obstacle on the road actually helps us on our journey.

Respect what is best in the universe, which is the force that utilizes and directs all things. Similarly, respect what is best within yourself, as it is of the same nature. In yourself as well, the force that makes use of everything else and directs your life is present. In the modern style: If something does not harm the state, it does not harm the citizen. Whenever harm appears, follow this rule: if the state is not harmed, then I am not harmed. But if the state is harmed, do not be angry with the one causing harm. Show them where they went wrong.

Remember how quickly things come and go, both the things that exist and the things that are created. Substance is like a river constantly flowing, and things are always changing, with infinite variations in causes. There is hardly anything that remains still. Also, consider the vast abyss of the past and future, in which all things disappear. So, how can someone not be foolish to be proud or distressed by such things and make themselves miserable? These things only trouble them for a short time.

Think about the universal substance, of which you have a very small portion, and universal time, of which you only have a short and indivisible interval. Also, think about what is determined by destiny and how small a part you are in it.

If someone wrongs me, let them deal with it. They have their own disposition and actions. I have what the universal nature wants me to have, and I do what my nature currently desires.

Let the ruling part of your soul, the part that leads and governs, remain undisturbed by bodily sensations of pleasure or pain. Do not unite with those sensations, but limit them to their own parts. However, when these sensations reach the mind due to the natural sympathy that exists in a unified body, do not resist them, as they are natural. But do not let the ruling part of your soul add the opinion that they are either good or bad.

Live with the gods. And you live with the gods when you constantly show them that your own soul is content with what is assigned to you and that you do everything the divine nature within you wishes. This divine nature, given to every person as their guardian and guide by Zeus, is their understanding and reason.

Are you angry with someone whose armpits stink? Are you angry with someone whose breath smells bad? What good will this anger do you? It is natural for such emanations to come from such things, but the person has reason, it will be said, and if they make an effort, they can discover where they offend. I wish you luck with your discovery. So, if you have reason, use your rational faculty to stir up their rational faculty. Show them their error, advise them. If they listen, you will cure them, and there is no need for anger. Neither a tragic actor nor a whore...

Live as you intend to when you are gone...you have the power to live that way here. But if others do not allow it, then leave life, but without suffering harm. If the house is smoky, I leave. Why do you think this is a problem? But as long as nothing drives me away, I remain free, and no one can stop me from doing what I choose, which is in accordance with the nature of a rational and social being.

The intelligence of the universe is social. It has made inferior things for the sake of the superior and has arranged the superior things to be in harmony with each other. See how it has subordinated, coordinated, and assigned each thing its proper share, and has brought together the best things in concord.

How have you behaved towards the gods, your parents, siblings, children, teachers, those who cared for you in infancy, friends, relatives, and slaves? Consider if you have treated them all in a way that it can be said of you: "They have never wronged a person in word or deed." And remember how many things you have gone through, and how much you have endured. Your life's story is now complete and your service is finished. Think about all the beautiful things you have seen, and the pleasures and pains you have disregarded. Consider how many so-called honorable things you have rejected, and how many unkind people you have shown kindness to.

Why do unskilled and ignorant souls bother someone who has skill and knowledge? What soul possesses skill and knowledge? The one that understands beginnings and endings, and comprehends the reason that governs all matter and time, guiding the universe through its fixed cycles.

Soon, very soon, you will turn to ashes or become a skeleton, and you may become just a name or not even that. But a name is merely a sound and an echo. The things that are highly valued in life are empty, decaying, and insignificant, much like little dogs biting each other or children quarreling, laughing, and then suddenly weeping. But loyalty, modesty, justice, and truth have disappeared from the earth and ascended to Olympus. So, what is still keeping you here? If the objects of your senses are constantly changing and never staying still, and your senses are dull and easily deceived, and your soul itself is nothing more than a vapor from your blood. But to have a good reputation in this world is meaningless. So why not wait calmly for your end, whether it is extinction or transition to another state? And until that time comes, what is sufficient? What else but to honor and bless the gods, to do good to others, and to practice patience and self-control? But as for everything that lies beyond the limitations of your mortal body and breath, remember that it is neither thin nor within your control.

If you can follow the right path, think and act in the right way, you can live a life of constant happiness. These two things are common to both the soul of God and the soul of man, and to the soul of every rational being: not to be hindered by others, and to consider goodness as consisting in the disposition for justice and its practice, finding satisfaction in this.

If this situation is not my fault, nor a result of my own wrongdoing, and the common welfare is not harmed, why should I be troubled by it? And what harm does it cause to the common welfare?

Do not be carried away by appearances, but provide assistance to all according to your ability and their deserving. And if they have suffered loss in matters that are unimportant, do not consider it a true loss. For that is a bad habit. Just as an old man, when he leaves, asks for his foster-child's spinning top back, remembering that it is just a toy, do the same in this case.

When you are speaking on the platform, have you forgotten, my friend, what these things truly are? Yes, but they are of great concern to these people. Will you also allow yourself to be made a fool for these things? I used to be a fortunate man, but I lost it, I don't know how. But to be fortunate means to have cultivated a good fortune for oneself: a good disposition of the soul, good emotions, and good actions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK SIX

The substance of the universe is obedient and adaptable, and the reason that governs it has no inclination towards doing evil, for it has no ill will and does not harm anything. Rather, all things are created and perfected according to this reason.

Do not let it matter to you whether you are cold or warm, as long as you are fulfilling your duty. Whether you are drowsy or well-rested, whether you are criticized or praised, whether you are dying or engaged in another activity. For dying is simply one of the acts of life, and it is enough to do well in whatever task is at hand.

Look within yourself. Do not let the unique qualities or value of anything escape your attention. All things change quickly, either turning into vapor if everything is made of the same substance, or dispersing. The reason that governs knows its own disposition, actions, and the material it works with. The best way to seek revenge is not to become like the wrongdoer. Find pleasure in one thing and find rest in it, moving from one social activity to another while thinking of God. The ruling principle is constantly evolving and shaping itself, and it also perceives everything that happens as it wills. Everything is accomplished in accordance with the nature of the universe, not any other external or independent nature. The universe can either be a chaotic and tangled mess, or it can be unity, order, and providence. If it is the former, why should I desire to stay in a random combination of things and such disorder? Why should I care about anything other than becoming earth in the end? And why should I be disturbed, as the dispersion of my elements will happen no matter what I do. But if the latter is true, then I respect, stand firm, and trust in the one who governs. 

When circumstances force you to be disturbed, quickly return to yourself and don't stay out of tune longer than necessary. You will have more control over your inner harmony by constantly returning to it. If you had both a stepmother and a mother, you would be respectful to your stepmother but always return to your mother. Let the court and philosophy be like your stepmother and mother: frequently return to philosophy and find solace in it, so that whatever you encounter in the court seems tolerable and you appear tolerable in the court. 

When we have food in front of us, we recognize that it is the dead body of a fish, bird, or pig. We also see that Falernian wine is just grape juice, and a purple robe is made of sheep's wool dyed with the blood of a shellfish. These impressions reveal the true nature of things. We should act in the same way throughout life, exposing the worthlessness behind things that appear most admirable and stripping away the words that elevate them. Outward appearances deceive reason, and when you are most certain that you are involved in worthwhile pursuits, that is when it deceives you the most. Consider what Crates says about Xenocrates himself. 

Most things that the majority admire are related to general objects held together by cohesion or natural organization, such as stones, wood, fig trees, vines, and olives. Those that are admired by more reasonable people are related to living beings held together by a life force, like flocks and herds. Those admired by more educated individuals are things held together by a rational soul, not a universal soul, but a soul that is skilled in some art or knowledgeable in some other way, or simply rational because it possesses many slaves. But those who value a rational soul, a universal soul suitable for political life, regard nothing else except this. Above all, they keep their soul in a state and activity that aligns with reason and social life, and they work together with those who are of the same kind. 

Some things are coming into existence, while others are fading away, and what is emerging is already disappearing. Motions and changes are constantly renewing the world, just as time is always renewing the infinite duration of ages. In this ever-flowing stream, where nothing remains constant, what value should we place on things that pass by quickly? It's like falling in love with a sparrow that has already flown out of sight. This is the nature of every person's life, like the exhalation of breath and the inhalation of air. Just as we breathe in and out every moment, so too do we receive our respiratory power at birth and give it back to the world from which it came.

Neither transpiration in plants, nor respiration in animals, nor the impressions we receive from appearances, nor the desires that move us like puppets, nor the act of gathering in herds, nor the act of nourishing ourselves with food should be valued. These are all comparable to separating and discarding the useless parts of our food. So, what is truly worth valuing? Being applauded by others? No. We should not value the applause of others, for the praise that comes from the majority is merely empty words. So, if we give up this worthless thing called fame, what remains that is worth valuing? In my opinion, it is to govern and discipline ourselves according to our own nature, which is the aim of all occupations and arts. Every art seeks to create something that is suited to its purpose, whether it is a vine-grower tending to the vine, a horse trainer, or a dog trainer. Similarly, the education and teaching of youth have a purpose. This is where the value lies in education and teaching. And if this is done well, there is no need to seek anything else. Will you not cease to value many other things too? Then you will be free, self-sufficient for your own happiness, and without passion. Otherwise, you will be envious, jealous, and suspicious of those who can take away the things you value, and you will plot against those who possess what you desire. You will constantly be in a state of disturbance and find fault with the gods. But if you reverence and honor your own mind, you will be content with yourself, in harmony with society, and in agreement with the gods, appreciating all that they give and ordain.

The movements of the elements are everywhere, above, below, and all around. But the movement of virtue is not found in any of these. It is something more divine, quietly advancing along its path. How strange it is that people do not praise those who live in the same time and share the same existence, but instead seek praise from future generations, from people they have never met and will never meet. It is similar to being saddened because those who lived before us did not praise us.

If something seems difficult to accomplish on your own, do not think it is impossible for humanity. But if something is possible for humans and aligns with their nature, believe that you can achieve it as well.

In the realm of physical exercise, imagine that someone has scratched you with their nails and inflicted a wound on your head. We do not show signs of anger, offense, or suspicion towards them. Instead, we are cautious around them, not as enemies or with suspicion, but quietly avoiding them. Let your behavior in all other aspects of life be like this. Overlook many things in those who are like opponents in the gymnasium. As I mentioned before, it is within our power to avoid them and not harbor suspicion or hatred. If anyone can convince and show me that my thoughts and actions are incorrect, I am willing to change. I am constantly seeking the truth, which has never harmed anyone. However, those who remain in their errors and ignorance are the ones who suffer.

I focus on fulfilling my duties and do not bother with things that lack life, reason, or direction. When it comes to animals and inanimate objects, since I have reason and they do not, I use them with generosity and a liberal mindset. But when it comes to fellow humans, who possess reason, I interact with them in a social manner. I always call upon the gods and do not worry about how long I do so, as even three hours spent in this manner are sufficient.

When Alexander the Great and his groom died, they both reached the same state. They either became part of the same universal principles or were scattered among the atoms. Consider how many things happen within each of us, both concerning our bodies and our souls, within the same indivisible moment. Therefore, it should not be surprising that many, or rather all, things that exist in the cosmos, which we consider the entirety, exist simultaneously.

If someone were to ask you how to spell the name Antoninus, would you shout out each letter? And if they became angry, would you also become angry? No, you would continue calmly and simply count each letter. Similarly, in life, remember that every duty consists of certain parts. It is your duty to observe them, without being disturbed or showing anger towards those who are angry with you. Keep moving forward and complete what is set before you.

It is cruel to deny others the pursuit of what they believe to be suitable for their nature and beneficial. Yet, in a way, you do so when you become upset with them for their wrongdoings. They are surely drawn towards things because they deem them suitable and advantageous. - But this is not true. - Teach and guide them without anger.

Death is the cessation of sensory impressions, the urges of appetites, the wandering thoughts, and the service to the body.

It is shameful for the soul to give up before the body does in this life.

Be careful not to become corrupted like a Caesar, not to be stained by such behavior. These things can happen. Stay true to simplicity, goodness, purity, seriousness, free from pretense, a champion of justice, a worshipper of the gods, kind, affectionate, and diligent in all virtuous actions. Strive to remain the person that philosophy intended you to be.

Respect the gods and assist your fellow human beings. Life is short. The only worthwhile outcome of this earthly existence is a pious nature and acts that benefit society. Approach everything as a disciple of Antoninus. Remember his consistency in every action that aligned with reason, his composure in all things, his devotion, the calmness of his demeanor, his kindness, his indifference towards empty fame, his efforts to comprehend things, and his refusal to let anything go without careful examination and understanding. Remember how he endured unjust blame without blaming others in return, how he never rushed into anything, how he disregarded gossip, and how he meticulously observed manners and actions. He refrained from reproaching others, was not fearful or suspicious, and did not engage in sophistry. He was content with little, such as modest accommodations, a simple bed, plain clothing, basic food, and minimal staff. He was hardworking and patient, and due to his disciplined diet, he could last until evening without needing any breaks except at the usual time. He maintained steadfast and consistent friendships, tolerated differing opinions, and took pleasure in being shown a better way. He was devout without being superstitious. Strive to emulate all of this so that when your final hour arrives, you may have as clear a conscience as he did. 

Come back to your senses and remind yourself that what troubled you were only dreams when you awaken from sleep. Now, in your waking hours, view the things around you with the same detachment as you did those dreams. 

I am composed of a small body and a soul. To this little body, everything is indifferent, as it lacks the ability to perceive distinctions. However, to the mind, only those things that are not the result of its own activity are indifferent. But all the things that are within its control are subject to its power. Yet, this power only extends to present activities, as both past and future mental activities are indifferent for the present moment. 

The labor performed by the hand or the foot is not contrary to nature, as long as each fulfills its respective function. Similarly, for a person, their labor is not contrary to nature as long as it aligns with human capabilities. Therefore, if labor is not contrary to one's nature, it cannot be considered evil. 

Consider how many pleasures have been enjoyed by criminals, murderers, and tyrants. Do you not see how craftsmen adapt to those who lack skill in their trade to a certain extent, but still adhere to the principles of their craft? Is it not strange that architects and physicians show more respect for the principles of their respective arts than humans do for their own reason, which is shared with the gods? 

Asia and Europe are mere corners of the universe, the entire sea is a droplet in the universe, Athos is a tiny speck in the universe, and the present moment is but a fleeting point in eternity. All things are small, impermanent, and subject to change. They all originate from that universal governing power, either directly or in a sequence. Therefore, the ferocious jaws of a lion, poisonous substances, and every harmful thing, such as thorns or mud, are all by-products of the grand and beautiful. Do not assume that they are different from that which you revere, but instead form a fair judgment of their common source. 

Whoever has witnessed present things has seen everything that has occurred throughout eternity and will continue for an endless time. For all things are of the same nature and form. 

Regularly contemplate the interconnectedness of all things in the universe and their relationships with one another. In a way, all things are intertwined and supportive of one another, as one thing follows another in a harmonious and unified manner due to the active movement and mutual collaboration of substances. Adapt yourself to the circumstances in which you find yourself, and love the people with whom you have been placed, but do it genuinely and sincerely. Every tool or object, if it fulfills its purpose, is good, even though its creator may not be present. However, in things that are naturally held together, there is a power within them that created them, and it is worthy of reverence. If you live and act according to the will of this power, everything within you is aligned with intelligence. And likewise, in the universe, everything is in accordance with intelligence.

If you consider anything that is beyond your control to be either good or bad for you, then when something bad happens or you lose something good, you will blame the gods and hate those who caused the misfortune or loss, or those who you suspect might be the cause. This is unjust, as we should not differentiate between these things. But if we only judge things within our control to be good or bad, then there is no reason to find fault with God or hold a hostile attitude towards others.

We are all working together towards a common goal, some with knowledge and intention, and others without knowing what they do. Like people who work while they are asleep, as Heraclitus said, they are laborers and collaborators in the events of the universe. However, people collaborate in different ways, even those who find fault with or try to hinder what happens. The universe even needs people like them. It is up to you to understand the kind of worker you are placing yourself among. The one who governs all things will surely make good use of you and include you among those who collaborate towards the same goal. Do not be like the insignificant and ridiculous character in the play, as mentioned by Chrysippus.

Does the sun try to do the work of the rain, or Aesculapius the work of the Earth? And what about the stars? They are different, yet they work together towards the same end.

If the gods have predetermined my fate and the things that will happen to me, they have done so wisely, for it is hard to imagine a deity without foresight. And why would they desire to harm me? What advantage would they gain from that, or the greater whole, which is the object of their providence? But even if they have not predetermined things specifically for me, they have surely predetermined the overall plan, and I should accept with pleasure the events that occur as a result of this universal arrangement. However, if they have not predetermined anything - which is a wicked belief, and if we do believe it, then let us not make sacrifices, pray, swear by them, or do anything else as if the gods were present and lived among us - but if they have not predetermined anything, I have the ability to determine for myself and seek what is beneficial. And what is beneficial for every person is what aligns with their own nature and constitution. My nature is rational and social, and my city and country, as Antoninus, is Rome, but as a human being, it is the world. Therefore, what is beneficial for these cities is beneficial for me alone. Whatever happens to any person is in the interest of the universal. This should be enough. Furthermore, you will observe that whatever is beneficial to one person is also beneficial to others. Let the word "beneficial" be understood here in its common sense, referring to things that are neither good nor bad. In the amphitheatre and similar places, the continuous sight of the same things and the lack of variety make the spectacle boring. The same goes for life as a whole; everything is essentially the same. So, how long will this go on? 

Think constantly about the fact that all kinds of people, pursuits, and nations have died. Let your thoughts reach even the most insignificant individuals like Philistion, Phoebus, and Origanion. Now, shift your thoughts to other types of people. We should focus on a place where there are great orators and noble philosophers like Heraclitus, Pythagoras, and Socrates. There are also many heroes from the past, as well as generals and tyrants. Additionally, there are individuals like Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes, and others with exceptional natural talents, great minds, a love for hard work, and a mocking attitude towards the fleeting nature of human life, such as Menippus and those like him. Consider that all these people have long turned to dust. What harm does it do to them? And what about those whose names are completely unknown? 

One thing holds great value here: living a life of truth and justice, with a benevolent disposition even towards liars and unjust individuals. 

When you want to find delight, think about the virtues of those who live with you. For example, appreciate the activity of one person, the modesty of another, the generosity of a third, or any other positive quality of a fourth individual. There is nothing more delightful than witnessing examples of virtue in the actions and character of those around us. Therefore, we must keep these examples in mind. 

I assume you are not dissatisfied because you only possess a certain amount of money and not three hundred times more. So, do not be dissatisfied with the fact that you can only live a certain number of years and not more. Just as you are content with the amount of wealth that has been given to you, be content with the time you have been allotted. 

Let us try to persuade others, but also act against their will when the principles of justice demand it. However, if someone obstructs your path with force, find contentment and tranquility, and use the obstacle as an opportunity to exercise another virtue. Remember that your attempt had a condition attached to it, as you did not aim to achieve the impossible. So, what did you desire? Something along the lines of this effort. And you will have achieved your goal if the things that motivated you are accomplished. 

Someone who seeks fame considers the accomplishments of others to be their own good. Someone who pursues pleasure finds satisfaction in their own sensations. But someone who possesses understanding recognizes that their own actions are their true good. 

We have the power to not form an opinion about something and to remain undisturbed in our soul. Things themselves do not have the inherent ability to shape our judgments. 

Train yourself to listen carefully to what others say and try to understand their perspective as best as you can. 

What is harmful to the collective is also harmful to the individual. If sailors were to insult the helmsman or the sick were to berate the doctor, would they listen to anyone else? How could the helmsman ensure the safety of those on the ship or the doctor promote the health of those under their care? 

So many people with whom I entered this world have already left it. 

To someone with jaundice, honey tastes bitter; to someone bitten by a mad dog, water instills fear; and to young children, a ball is a wonderful thing. Why, then, am I angry? Do you think that a false opinion has less power than the bile in someone with jaundice or the poison in someone bitten by a mad dog? 

No one can prevent you from living according to your own rational nature. Nothing will happen to you that goes against the laws of the universe. 

What kind of people do others want to please, and for what reasons and through what actions? How quickly time will erase everything, and how much it has already erased. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK SEVEN

What is badness? It is something that you have seen many times before. And in the midst of everything that happens, always remember that it is something you have seen often before. You will find the same things everywhere, just as they were in the old histories of the past and still are today in cities and houses. There is nothing new; everything is familiar and temporary.

Our principles can only become lifeless if the thoughts that correspond to them are extinguished. But it is within your power to constantly ignite these thoughts into a flame. I can have the right opinion about anything I should. If I can, why should I be disturbed? External things have no relation to my mind.

Maintain this state of mind and stand tall. It is in your power to regain your life. Look at things as you used to; this is how you will recover your life.

All the trivial distractions, like shows, plays, animals, and mundane tasks, are all the same. Therefore, it is your duty to maintain good humor and not show arrogance. Understand that a person's worth is determined by the value of the things they occupy themselves with. 

During conversations, pay attention to what is being said, and in every action, observe what is happening. In conversations, immediately understand their purpose, and in actions, carefully consider what they signify.

Is my understanding enough for this task or not? If it is enough, I will use it as a tool provided by the universe. But if it is not enough, I will either step aside and let someone more capable take over, unless there is a reason why I shouldn't. Or I will do my best with the help of someone who can assist me in fulfilling what is currently beneficial and useful for the greater good. Whatever I can do, whether alone or with another person, should be directed towards what is useful and beneficial for society.

So many people who were once famous have been forgotten, and many who celebrated the fame of others have long been deceased. Do not be ashamed to ask for help; your duty is to fulfill your responsibilities like a soldier in a battle. So, if you are unable to accomplish something on your own due to a limitation, but with the assistance of another, it becomes possible, then accept the help.

Do not let future events disturb you, for you will face them when necessary, equipped with the same reason you use for present matters. Everything is interconnected, and this connection is sacred. There is hardly anything that is not related to something else. Everything is part of one unified universe, governed by one God, composed of one substance, and bound by one law. There is one common reason among all intelligent beings and one truth. And if there is indeed one perfection for all creatures that share the same reason and belong to the same lineage.

All material things eventually merge back into the whole, and all causal aspects are quickly absorbed back into the universal reason. The memory of everything is easily forgotten with time. To a rational being, acting in accordance with nature is acting in accordance with reason.

Stand tall, or be made to stand tall.

Just as the members of a body are united, rational beings exist separately but are designed for cooperation. You will understand this better if you remind yourself often that you are a member of the system of rational beings. But if thou sayest that thou art a part, thou dost not yet love men from thy heart; beneficence does not yet delight thee for its own sake; thou still doest it merely as a matter of propriety, and not yet as doing good to thyself. Let external events fall as they may on the parts that can feel their effects. If those parts choose to complain, let them. But I, unless I consider what has happened to be an evil, am not harmed. And I have the power not to think of it as such.

No matter what anyone does or says, I must remain good, just as if the gold, or the emerald, or the purple were always saying this, "No matter what anyone does or says, I must remain emerald and maintain my color." The rational faculty does not disturb itself; I mean, it does not frighten itself or cause itself pain. But if someone else can frighten or pain it, let them do so. The faculty itself will not turn itself into such ways by its own judgment. Let the body take care, if it can, to suffer nothing, and let it speak if it does suffer. But the soul itself, which is subject to fear and pain, which has the complete power to form an opinion about these things, will suffer nothing. It will never deviate into such a judgment. The guiding principle within itself wants nothing, unless it creates a want for itself. Therefore, it is both free from disturbance and unimpeded, if it does not disturb and impede itself.

Happiness is a good thing. So what are you doing here, O imagination? I beg you, go away as you came, for I do not want you. But you have come in your old fashion. I am not angry with you, just go away.

Is anyone afraid of change? Well, what can happen without change? What is more pleasing or more suitable to the nature of the universe? Can you take a bath without the water undergoing change? Can you be nourished without the food undergoing change? Can anything else useful be accomplished without change? Don't you see then that for yourself to change is just the same, and equally necessary for the nature of the universe?

All bodies are carried through the universal substance like a furious torrent, being naturally united with and cooperating with the whole, just as the parts of our body cooperate with one another. How many Chrysippuses, how many Socrateses, how many Epictetuses has time already swallowed up? And let the same thought occur to you with regards to every person and thing.

The only thing that worries me is that I might do something that the human nature does not allow, or in a way that it does not allow, or at a time when it does not allow.

Forgetfulness of all things is near, and the forgetfulness of you by all is near.

It is unique to humans to love even those who do wrong. And this happens if when they do wrong, you consider that they are kinsmen, and that they do wrong out of ignorance and unintentionally, and that both of you will soon die. Above all, remember that the wrongdoer has not harmed you, for they have not made your rational faculty worse than it was before.

The universal nature, out of the universal substance, molds a horse as if it were wax, and when it breaks it apart, it uses the material for a tree, then for a man, then for something else. Each of these things exists for a very short time. But it is not a hardship for the vessel to be broken apart, just as there was none in its being put together.

A scowling look is completely unnatural. When it is assumed frequently, all beauty fades away and eventually is completely extinguished, unable to be rekindled. Try to conclude from this fact that it is contrary to reason. For if even the perception of doing wrong disappears, what reason is there to continue living?

Nature, which governs the whole, will soon change all the things you see, and out of their substance, it will create other things, and again other things from the substance of those, in order to keep the world always new. When someone wrongs you, consider their perspective on good and evil. This will lead you to feel pity rather than wonder or anger. Either you agree with their notion of what is good, or you have a different perspective in the same vein. In either case, it is your duty to forgive them. If you don't believe their actions are good or evil, you will be more inclined to be understanding towards their error.

Focus on what you have rather than what you lack. Choose the best among the things you possess and imagine how much you would desire them if you didn't have them. However, be cautious not to become so attached to them that you overvalue them and feel disturbed when you don't have them.

Take time to reflect within yourself. The rational part of your mind finds contentment in doing what is just, leading to tranquility. Erase unnecessary thoughts and distractions. Stay present and understand what is happening to you and to others. Analyze every situation by separating its causes and its physical aspects. Contemplate your mortality. Leave the wrongs done by others where they occurred.

Pay attention to what is being communicated to you. Let your understanding delve into the actions and the actors behind them. Cultivate simplicity, modesty, and indifference towards things that fall between virtue and vice. Love humanity. Follow a higher power. Remember that law governs all.

Regarding death: It may be a dispersal, a breakdown into atoms, or annihilation. It could mean the end or a transformation. 

About pain: Intolerable pain consumes us, but enduring pain is manageable. The mind finds tranquility by turning inward, and its governing faculty remains unaffected. However, the parts of us that are harmed by pain should have a say if they can.

Regarding fame: Examine the minds of those who seek it. Observe what they are and what they avoid and pursue. Remember that just as new sand covers old sand, life events soon overshadow previous ones.

From Plato: Can a person with an elevated mind, who perceives all of time and substance, consider human life to be significant? No, it is impossible. Such a person will also believe that death is not an evil.

From Antisthenes: It is noble to do good and be mistreated. It is ignoble for the face to obey and regulate itself while the mind remains unregulated.

There is no use in distressing ourselves over things that don't care about our distress. Let us find joy in the immortal gods and ourselves. Life must be harvested like ripe ears of corn. One person is born, another dies. If the gods don't care for me and my children, there must be a reason. Because goodness and justice are with me. No need to join others in their lamentations or be consumed by intense emotions.

From Plato: I would provide this individual with a sufficient response: You are mistaken if you believe that a person who is capable of anything should consider the risk of life or death. Instead, they should focus solely on whether their actions are just or unjust, the works of a good or bad person. Therefore, wherever a person has chosen to be or has been placed by a leader, they should stay and face the risk, without calculating the consequences of death or anything else, before the disgrace of deserting their post. But, my dear friend, think about whether what is noble and good is not something different from simply saving and being saved. Consider that for a truly virtuous person, the concept of living for a certain amount of time should be dismissed from their thoughts. There should be no attachment to life. Instead, one should entrust these matters to a higher power and believe what women say, that no one can escape their destiny. The next question to ponder is how to make the most of the time that one has to live.

Take a moment to observe the movements of the stars, as if you were traveling alongside them. Constantly contemplate the transformations of the elements into one another. These thoughts will cleanse the impurities of earthly life.

Plato said something profound: when discussing human matters, one should also view earthly things as if from a higher perspective. Look at them in their gatherings, armies, agricultural work, marriages, treaties, births, deaths, the noise of the courts of justice, desolate places, different nations of barbarians, feasts, lamentations, markets—a mixture of all things and an organized combination of opposites.

Consider the past, the great shifts in political power. You can also foresee what is to come. The future will undoubtedly follow a similar pattern, and it is unlikely to deviate from the order of current events. Therefore, contemplating human life for forty years is equivalent to contemplating it for ten thousand years. What more will you see?

That which originates from the earth will return to the earth. However, that which originates from divine origins will return to the heavenly realms. This is either the dissolution of the intermingling of atoms or the scattering of non-sentient elements.

By using food, drinks, and clever techniques, we can divert the course of death. We must endure the winds that heaven sends our way and work diligently without complaint.

Another person may be more skilled at defeating their opponent, but they are not more sociable, modest, or better prepared to face whatever comes their way. They are not more considerate of their neighbor's faults. When we can act in accordance with reason, which is shared by both gods and humans, there is nothing to fear. Where we can benefit from an activity that aligns with our nature and constitution, there is no reason to suspect harm.

In every situation and at all times, you have the power to accept your current condition with piety and to treat those around you justly. Examine your thoughts carefully, so that nothing enters without proper examination.

Don't look to others for their guiding principles, but instead look directly to where nature leads you. This includes both the universal nature through the events that happen to you and your own nature through the actions that you must take. Every being should act in accordance with its own constitution, and all other things have been created for the sake of rational beings. Just as among irrational beings, the lower exists for the sake of the higher, rational beings exist for the sake of one another.

The primary principle in human nature is sociality. The second is to not give in to the desires of the body. The rational and intelligent part of us must restrain itself and not be overwhelmed by the senses or appetites, as both are animalistic. The intelligent part asserts its superiority and does not allow itself to be overpowered by the others. And rightly so, as it is naturally equipped to utilize all of them. The third aspect of the rational nature is freedom from error and deception. So, let the ruling principle hold fast to these things and proceed accordingly. It will have what is rightfully its own.

Consider yourself to be dead and have already lived your life up until this point. Live the remainder of your life in accordance with nature. Love only what happens to you and is woven into the fabric of your destiny. What could be more fitting? In every situation, keep in mind those who have experienced the same things, how they were bothered by them, treated them as strange occurrences, and criticized them. And where are they now? Nowhere. So why do you choose to act the same way? Why do you not let go of these disturbances that go against nature, and leave them to those who cause them and are affected by them? Why are you not completely focused on using the things that happen to you in the right way? If you do, you will use them well and they will become material for you to work with. Pay attention to yourself, and make a conscious effort to be a good person in every action you take. Remember to... Look within. Within is the source of goodness, and it will continually bubble up if you keep digging. 

Your body should be harmonious and show no irregularity in movement or posture. Just as the mind expresses intelligence and propriety in the face, these qualities should also be evident in the entire body. However, all of these things should be observed naturally, without any artificiality. 

The art of living is more akin to the art of wrestling than to dancing, in that it should be prepared and steadfast to confront sudden and unexpected challenges. 

Always consider the opinions and guiding principles of those whose approval you seek. By doing so, you will neither blame those who offend unintentionally, nor will you crave their approval, as you will understand the basis of their opinions and desires. 

According to the philosopher, every soul is involuntarily deprived of truth, and therefore also deprived of justice, temperance, benevolence, and similar virtues. It is crucial to constantly bear this in mind, as it will lead you to be more compassionate towards others. 

In every instance of pain, remember that there is no shame in it, nor does it diminish your rational or social intelligence. Indeed, as Epicurus said, most pains are neither unbearable nor everlasting, as long as you keep in mind their limits and do not add to them through imagination. Also remember that many things we find unpleasant, such as excessive drowsiness, being overheated, or loss of appetite, are not truly painful. So when you feel discontented about such things, remind yourself that you are succumbing to pain. 

Be careful not to treat inhumane individuals as they treat fellow human beings. Who is to say that Telauges was not of superior character to Socrates? It is not enough to say that Socrates died a more noble death, argued more skillfully with the sophists, endured the cold night, refused to arrest Leon of Salamis out of nobility, or walked confidently in the streets – though one may have doubts about the truth of this last claim. We should instead inquire about the kind of soul Socrates possessed, whether he was content with being just to others and pious towards the gods, not letting himself be bothered by the wickedness of others, not becoming a slave to anyone's ignorance, not regarding anything that came his way as foreign, not enduring it as unbearable, and not allowing his understanding to sympathize with the sufferings of the frail body. 

Nature has not mixed the intelligence with the composition of the body in a way that prevents you from defining yourself and bringing everything that is yours under your control. It is entirely possible to be a divine individual and not be recognized as such by anyone. Always keep this in mind, along with the fact that very little is truly necessary for a happy life. And because you have given up on becoming a dialectician and skilled in the knowledge of nature, don't give up on the hope of being free, modest, social, and obedient to God. You have the power to live without being compelled, in a state of tranquility, even if the whole world criticizes you and even if you face challenges. Nothing stops your mind from maintaining tranquility, making fair judgments about everything around you, and making use of the things presented to you. Your judgment should say, "This is what you truly are, regardless of what others may think," and your use should say, "You are what I was looking for." To me, everything that presents itself is an opportunity for virtue, both rational and social, and for artistic expression, which belongs to both man and God. Everything that happens has a relationship with either God or man and is neither new nor difficult to handle, but rather common and suitable material to work with.

The perfection of moral character lies in living each day as if it were your last, without being overly excited, apathetic, or hypocritical.

The immortal gods do not get upset by continuously tolerating flawed and bad human beings for such a long time; in fact, they take care of them in every way. But you, who are destined to end so soon, are you tired of enduring the bad, especially when you are also one of them? It is foolish for a person not to distance themselves from their own flaws, which is indeed possible, but to distance themselves from the flaws of others, which is impossible.

Anything that the rational and social faculty finds to be unintelligent and unsocial is considered inferior to itself.

When you perform a good deed and someone benefits from it, why do you seek something else, like fools do, to either gain a reputation for doing good or to receive something in return? No one gets tired of receiving what is useful. Acting according to nature is useful. So, don't get tired of receiving what is useful by doing it for others.

The nature of the gods moved them to create the universe. But now, either everything that happens is a result of cause and effect, or even the significant things that the ruling power of the universe directs its movement towards are not governed by rational principles. If you remember this, you will find more tranquility in many things.

BOOK EIGHT

This reflection also helps to eliminate the desire for empty fame. It is no longer within your control to have lived your entire life, or at least your life from youth onwards, like a philosopher. It is evident to many, including yourself, that you are far from being a philosopher. You have fallen into disorder, making it difficult for you to gain the reputation of a philosopher. Your chosen way of life also opposes it. If you have truly realized where the problem lies, let go of the concern of how you appear to others and be content with living the rest of your life according to your nature's desires. Observe what your nature desires and let nothing else distract you. You have experienced many wanderings without finding happiness anywhere, not in logical arguments, wealth, reputation, pleasure, or anywhere else. So, where is it? It is found in doing what human nature requires. How can a person do this? By having principles that guide their emotions and actions. What principles? The ones that relate to good and bad: the belief that nothing is truly good for a person if it doesn't make them just, temperate, courageous, and free, and that nothing is truly bad if it doesn't go against these qualities. In every situation, ask yourself, "How does this relate to me? Will I regret it?" Time is short and everything will be gone when I am dead. What else do I need if what I am doing aligns with the intelligence and social nature of a being who follows the same laws as God?

Alexander, Gaius, and Pompeius are nothing compared to Diogenes, Heraclitus, and Socrates. The latter understood things, their causes, their essence, and their governing principles. But as for the former, they had so many things to worry about and were enslaved by them. Remember that people will continue to do the same things even if you burst.

The most important thing is not to be disturbed, as everything is in accordance with the nature of the universe. Soon, you will be nobody and nowhere, just like Hadrian and Augustus. Focus on your work, keeping in mind that it is your duty to be a good person and to fulfill the demands of human nature. Speak what you believe is just, but do so with a good attitude, modesty, and sincerity.

The nature of the universe has the task of moving things from one place to another, changing and transferring them. Everything is in a constant state of change, but we should not fear anything new. Everything is familiar to us, but the distribution of things remains the same.

Every being is content when it acts in accordance with its nature. A rational being acts well when it does not assent to falsehoods or uncertainties in its thoughts, when it engages in social actions, and when it directs its desires and aversions towards things within its control. It should be satisfied with everything assigned to it by the universal nature, of which every particular nature is a part. Just as a leaf is part of a plant's nature, human nature is part of a greater, intelligent, and just nature that gives everything its due.

Compare not one thing to another in every aspect, but consider all the parts of one thing in relation to all the parts of another.

You may not have the time or ability to read, but you have the ability to combat arrogance, to rise above pleasure and pain, and to not be bothered by fame or ungrateful people. Care for them instead.

Stop criticizing court life or yourself.

Repentance is only warranted when you have neglected something useful. The perfect good man should pursue what is truly good, which is always useful. Such a person would never repent of denying themselves sensual pleasures. Pleasure, therefore, is neither good nor useful.

Consider the nature, substance, form, purpose, and duration of things.

When you wake up reluctantly, remember that it is natural for humans to engage in social acts, while sleep is common to both humans and animals. What is natural to each individual is more suited to their own nature and more pleasing.

Apply the principles of physics, ethics, and dialectics to every impression on your soul, if possible. When encountering any individual, immediately ask yourself: What are this person's opinions on what is good and bad? If their opinions align with pleasure and pain, fame and shame, life and death, it will not surprise me if they act accordingly. I must remember that they are compelled to do so.

Just as it is not surprising for a fig tree to produce figs, it is not surprising for the world to produce certain things. It is also not surprising for a physician to treat a fever or for a helmsman to face unfavorable winds.

Changing your opinion and following someone who corrects your error is just as freeing as persisting in your error. It is your own choice, based on your own judgment and understanding.

If something is within your control, why are you doing it? But if it is in the control of another, who should you blame? Chance or the gods? Both options are foolish. You should blame no one. If you can, correct the cause of the problem. If you cannot, at least correct the situation itself. And if you cannot do even that, what is the point of finding fault? Everything should be done with purpose.

When something dies, it does not leave the universe. It stays here, undergoing change and dissolving into its elemental parts, which are part of the universe and yourself. And these parts also change without complaint.

Everything exists for a purpose, whether it be a horse or a vine. Why should you be surprised? Even the sun serves a purpose, just like the rest of the gods. What purpose do you serve? To pursue pleasure? Consider if this aligns with common sense.

Nature has considered the end just as much as the beginning and continuation in everything, like a person throwing up a ball. So what good is it for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it to come down or even fall? And what good is it for a bubble to stay intact, or harm for it to burst? The same can be said of a light.

Examine the body closely and see what it truly is. And observe how it changes as it ages or becomes sick.

Both the praiser and the praised, the rememberer and the remembered, are short-lived. All of this occurs in a small corner of the world, and even here, no one agrees, not even with themselves. The entire Earth is just a speck.

Focus on the matter at hand, whether it is an opinion, action, or word.

You suffer justly because you choose to be good tomorrow instead of being good today.

Am I doing anything? I do it for the benefit of humanity. Does something happen to me? I accept it and attribute it to the gods and the source of all things. Everything in life, just like bathing, can appear unpleasant and disgusting.

Lucilla saw Verus die, and then Lucilla died. Secunda saw Maximus die, and then Secunda died. Epitynchanus saw Diotimus die, and Epitynchanus died. Antoninus saw Faustina die, and then Antoninus died. This is the nature of everything. Celer saw Hadrian die, and then Celer died. And those clever individuals, whether seers or those filled with pride, where are they? For example, Charax, Demetrius the Platonist, Eudaemon, and others like them. They have all passed away long ago. Some have not even been remembered for a short time, while others have become the heroes of myths, and some have disappeared even from those stories. Remember that this little compound, yourself, will either dissolve, your breath extinguished, or it will be transferred elsewhere.

It brings satisfaction to a person to fulfill their duties as a human being. Now it is a proper work of a person to be kind to their own kind, to ignore the impulses of the senses, to make fair judgments of plausible appearances, and to observe the nature of the universe and the things that occur within it.

There are three relationships between you and other things: one to the body that surrounds you, the second to the divine cause from which all things come, and the third to those who live with you.

Pain is either a harm to the body - then let the body express its opinion on it - or to the soul. However, the soul has the power to maintain its own calmness and tranquility and not to view pain as a harm. For every judgment, action, desire, and aversion occur within oneself, and no harm can reach such heights.

Eliminate your negative thoughts by frequently reminding yourself: now I have the power to prevent any negativity from entering my soul, nor any desire or disturbance at all. Instead, I look at everything and understand its nature, and I use each thing according to its value. Remember this power that you possess from nature.

Speak appropriately in the senate and to everyone, without any pretense. Use plain and straightforward language.

The court of Augustus, his wife, daughter, descendants, ancestors, sister, Agrippa, relatives, close friends, Areius, Maecenas, physicians, and priests who perform sacrifices - the entire court is deceased. Then turn to others, not considering the death of a single individual, but rather the death of an entire lineage, like that of the Pompeii; and what is inscribed on their tombs - "The last of their lineage." Consider the struggles that those before them had to endure in order to leave behind a successor, and understand that inevitably, someone must be the last. Once again, contemplate the death of an entire lineage.

It is your duty to live well in every single action. If each action fulfills its duty to the best of its ability, be content. No one can hinder you from acting justly, soberly, and thoughtfully. Perhaps something external may present obstacles, but nothing can prevent you from acting in accordance with these virtues. By accepting the hindrance and being content to redirect your efforts towards what is allowed, another opportunity for action immediately arises, one that aligns with the principles we are discussing.

Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance, and be willing to let it go.

If you have ever seen a detached hand, foot, or head lying separate from the rest of the body, that is how a person makes themselves when they are not content with what occurs and isolate themselves from others or engage in unsocial behavior. Suppose you have detached yourself from the natural unity - for you were made by nature to be a part, but now you have severed that connection - yet there is a beautiful provision here: it is within your power to unite yourself once more. God has not granted this ability to any other part, to come together again once it has been separated and torn apart. But consider the kindness with which God has distinguished human beings, allowing them to never be fully separated from the universal. And even if they are separated, they have the opportunity to return, to be united, and to resume their place as a part.

Just as the nature of the universe has given every rational being all the other abilities it possesses, we have also received this power from it. Just as the universal nature converts and incorporates everything that obstructs and opposes it into itself, making those things a part of itself, the rational being can also make every hindrance its own material and use it for its intended purposes.

Do not distress yourself by thinking about your entire life. Do not let your thoughts immediately encompass all the various troubles that you may anticipate encountering. Instead, on each occasion, ask yourself, "What about this situation is truly unbearable and impossible to endure?" For you will be ashamed to admit it. Furthermore, remember that it is not the future or the past that troubles you, but only the present. But if thou takest away thy opinion about that which appears to give thee pain, thou thyself standest in perfect security. Who is this self? The reason. But I am not reason. Be it so. Let then the reason itself not trouble itself. But if any other part of thee suffers, let it have its own opinion about itself.

Hindrance to the perceptions of sense is an evil to the animal nature. Hindrance to the movements (desires) is equally an evil to the animal nature. And something else also is equally an impediment and an evil to the constitution of plants. So then that which is a hindrance to the intelligence is an evil to the intelligent nature. Apply all these things then to thyself. Does pain or sensuous pleasure affect thee? The senses will look to that. Has any obstacle opposed thee in thy efforts towards an object? If indeed thou wast making this effort absolutely, certainly this obstacle is an evil to thee considered as a rational animal. But if thou takest into consideration the usual course of things, thou hast not yet been injured nor even impeded. The things however which are proper to the understanding no other man is used to impede, for neither fire, nor iron, nor tyrant, nor abuse, touches it in any way. When it has been made a sphere, it continues a sphere.

It is not fit that I should give myself pain, for I have never intentionally given pain even to another.

Different things delight different people. But it is my delight to keep the ruling faculty sound without turning away either from any man or from any of the things which happen to men, but looking at and receiving all with welcome eyes and using everything according to its value.

See that thou secure this present time to thyself: for those who rather pursue posthumous fame do consider that the men of after time will be exactly such as these whom they cannot bear now; and both are mortal. And what is it in any way to thee if these men of after time utter this or that sound, or have this or that opinion about thee?

Take me and cast me where thou wilt; for there I shall keep my divine part tranquil, that is, content, if it can feel and act conformably to its proper constitution. Is this change of place sufficient reason why my soul should be unhappy and worse than it was, depressed, expanded, shrinking, affrighted? And what wilt thou find which is sufficient reason for this?

Nothing can happen to any man which is not a human accident, nor to an ox which is not according to the nature of an ox, nor to a vine which is not according to the nature of a vine, nor to a stone which is not proper to a stone. If then there happens to each thing both what is usual and natural, why shouldst thou complain? For the common nature brings nothing which may not be borne by thee.

If thou art pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs thee, but thy own judgement about it. And it is in thy power to wipe out this judgement now. But if anything in your own personality causes you distress, what is stopping you from changing your perspective? And even if you are upset because you're not doing something that you believe is right, why don't you take action instead of complaining? - But is there an insurmountable obstacle in the way? - Don't be upset then, because the reason it's not happening doesn't depend on you. - But it's not worth living if this can't be done. - Then peacefully depart from life, just like someone who dies while actively engaged and also content with the obstacles they face.

Remember that your mind is invincible when it is focused and satisfied with itself, even if it resists out of stubbornness. So imagine how strong it will be when it forms judgments aided by reason and deliberation. Therefore, a mind free from emotions is like a fortress, for there is nothing more secure for a person to seek refuge in and be impregnable in the future. So anyone who hasn't realized this is ignorant, but someone who has and doesn't seek refuge in it is unhappy.

Don't tell yourself anything beyond what the initial appearances indicate. Suppose you hear that someone spoke ill of you. That has been reported, but that you have been harmed has not. I see that my child is sick. I do see that, but I do not see that he is in danger. So always stick to the initial appearances and don't add anything from within, and then nothing will harm you. Or rather, add something, like someone who is aware of everything happening in the world.

A cucumber is bitter. - Throw it away. - There are briars in the road. - Turn away from them. - That's enough. Don't add, "Why were such things created in the world?" Because someone who understands nature will ridicule you, just as a carpenter or shoemaker would ridicule you if you complained about the sawdust and scraps in their workshop. And yet they have designated places to throw away those sawdust and scraps, while the universal nature has no external space. The remarkable part of her art is that even though she has limited herself, she transforms everything within her that appears to decay, age, or become useless into herself, and creates new things from the same materials. She doesn't require anything from outside or a place to discard what decays. She is satisfied with her own space, matter, and art.

Don't be sluggish in your actions, disorganized in your conversations, distracted in your thoughts, or so busy in life that you have no leisure.

Suppose people kill you, cut you into pieces, or curse you. What can these things do to prevent your mind from remaining pure, wise, sober, and just? For example, if someone were to stand by a clear and pure spring and curse it, the spring would continue to produce drinkable water. And if they were to throw dirt or filth into it, the spring would quickly disperse and cleanse them, remaining unpolluted. So how can you possess an eternal fountain instead of just a well? By continuously cultivating freedom along with contentment, simplicity, and modesty.

Someone who doesn't know what the world is doesn't know where they are. And someone who doesn't know the purpose of the world doesn't know who they are or what the world is for. But someone who has failed in any of these aspects can't even say why they exist themselves. What do you think of someone who seeks the approval of others, even if those people have no idea who they are or where they are? Do you want to be praised by someone who constantly curses themselves? Would you want to please someone who isn't pleased with themselves? Can someone truly be pleased with themselves if they regret almost everything they do?

Don't just go along with the crowd, let your intelligence align with the intelligence that encompasses everything. The power of intelligence is present everywhere and can be accessed by those who are willing, just like we can breathe in the air around us.

Generally, the wickedness of one person doesn't harm the universe, and specifically, it doesn't harm another individual. It only harms the person who has the power to free themselves from it but chooses not to. The free will of my neighbor is just as insignificant to me as their breath and flesh. Although we are made for each other, we each have our own purpose, so my neighbor's wickedness doesn't harm me. God didn't intend for my happiness to depend on someone else.

The light of the sun is spread out in all directions, but it's not scattered. When the light passes through a narrow opening into a dark room, it extends in a straight line and is divided when it encounters an obstacle. But it remains fixed and doesn't falter. This is how the understanding should be, extending and illuminating without forceful collisions or falling away. If a body doesn't allow the light in, it deprives itself of illumination.

If someone fears death, they either fear losing sensation or experiencing something different. But if you have no sensation, you won't feel any harm, and if you experience something different, you'll simply be a different kind of living being and continue to live.

We exist for each other. Either teach others or tolerate them.

The mind moves differently from an arrow. The mind moves straight forward, whether it exercises caution or engages in inquiry.

Understand and empathize with other people's perspectives, and let others do the same with you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK NINE

Anyone who acts unjustly also acts impiously. The universal nature has created rational beings to help and support each other, not to harm one another. So, anyone who goes against this divine will is clearly guilty of impiety. Likewise, anyone who lies is also guilty of impiety because the universal nature is the truth and the source of all that is true. Intentionally lying is unjust because it deceives others, and even unintentionally lying goes against the natural order of the world. By acting against the truth, one fights against the nature of the world and goes against their own nature, as they have neglected the abilities given to them by nature and can no longer distinguish between falsehood and truth. And indeed, anyone who pursues pleasure as good and avoids pain as evil is guilty of impiety. For it is necessary to find fault with the universal nature, claiming that it assigns things to the undeserving, as the bad often enjoy pleasure and possess things that bring pleasure, while the good experience pain and things that cause pain. Additionally, those who fear pain will also fear certain events in the world, which is also impiety. And those who pursue pleasure will not abstain from injustice, which is clearly impiety. Those who wish to follow nature should have the same mindset as the universal nature towards things that it equally affects. For pain, pleasure, death, life, honor, and dishonor, which the universal nature treats equally, anyone who is not equally affected is undoubtedly acting impiously. I say that the universal nature treats them equally because it did not create both without being equally affected towards both. It moved from a certain beginning to order things, having conceived principles and powers that produce beings and changes.

The happiest fate for a person would be to leave humanity without experiencing lying, hypocrisy, luxury, and pride. But if a person has had their fill of these things, the next best journey is to breathe out one's life. Have you decided to stay with vice, and has experience not yet convinced you to flee from this plague? The destruction of understanding is a far greater plague than any corruption or change in the surrounding atmosphere. The corruption is a plague for animals as they are animals, but the destruction of understanding is a plague for humans as they are humans.

Do not despise death, but be content with it, as it is one of the things that nature desires. Just as it is natural to be young, grow old, mature, have teeth, a beard, and gray hair, beget children, be pregnant, give birth, and experience all the other natural processes of life, dissolution is also a part of it. Therefore, a wise person should not be careless, impatient, or contemptuous towards death but should instead wait for it as one of nature's operations. Just as you wait for the child to be born from your wife's womb, be ready for the time when your soul will leave this body. If you seek a more relatable comfort that touches your heart, you will find the best acceptance of death by observing the things and morals from which you will be separated. It is not right to be offended by people, but it is your duty to care for them and tolerate them gently while remembering that you will no longer be with those who share your principles. This is the only thing, if there is any, that could make us reluctant to leave and attach us to life – to be able to live with those who share our principles. But now you see the great trouble that arises from the discord among those who live together, so you may say, "Come quickly, O death, lest I, too, forget myself."

Anyone who does wrong is doing wrong against themselves. Acting unjustly is acting unjustly towards oneself because it makes oneself bad. Often, injustice is committed by not doing something, not just by doing something. Your current opinion, based on understanding, and your current behavior aimed at social good, and your current state of contentment with everything that happens - that is sufficient. Get rid of imagination: control desire: suppress appetite: keep your rational mind in control.

Among animals without reason, life is distributed individually; but among rational animals, one intelligent soul is distributed, just as there is one earth for all earthy things, and we all see with one light and breathe one air, those of us with the ability to see and those with life.

All things that share something in common move towards what is similar to themselves. Earthy things gravitate towards the earth, liquids come together, and airy things do the same, so they require something to keep them apart and the application of force. Fire moves upwards due to its elemental nature, but it is so easily ignited by any other fire present that even slightly dry substances catch fire easily because there is less hindrance to ignition. Similarly, everything that shares the common intelligent nature moves in the same way towards what is similar to itself, or even more so. Because it is superior to all other things, it is more inclined to mingle and fuse with what is akin to it. Therefore, among animals without reason, we see swarms of bees, herds of cattle, the nurturing of young birds, and a kind of love; for even animals have souls, and the power that brings them together is seen to exert itself in a superior degree, in a way that has never been observed in plants, stones, or trees. However, in rational animals, there are political communities, friendships, families, and gatherings of people; and in wars, there are treaties and armistices. But in things that are even higher, unity exists in a way, even if they are separated, like in the stars. Therefore, ascent to a higher degree can produce sympathy even in separated things. See, then, what is happening now. Only intelligent animals have forgotten this mutual desire and inclination, and in them alone, the tendency to come together is not observed. But even though humans strive to avoid this union, they are inevitably caught and held by it because their nature is too strong for them. You will see what I mean if you just observe. It is more likely to find something earthy that does not come into contact with anything earthy than a man completely separated from other men.

Both man and God and the universe produce fruit; each produces it at the right time. But if these terms have been specifically assigned to the vine and similar things, it doesn't matter. Reason produces fruit for everyone and for itself, and from it, other things of the same kind as reason itself are produced.

If you are able, correct those who do wrong through teaching; but if you cannot, remember that you have been given the ability to be indulgent for this purpose. The gods, too, are indulgent towards such individuals, and they even help them achieve health, wealth, and reputation for certain purposes; that's how kind they are. You also have this power; so, who is stopping you?

Do not work as someone who is miserable, nor as someone who seeks pity or admiration. Instead, direct your will towards one thing only: to move forward and restrain yourself, as social reason requires.

Today, I have overcome all trouble, or rather, I have eliminated all trouble, for it was not external, but internal and in my opinions. All things are the same, familiar in experience, fleeting in time, and insignificant in substance. Everything now is just as it was in the time of those we have buried.

Things exist outside of us, separate from us, without any knowledge of themselves or expressing any judgment. What is it, then, that judges them? The faculty of reason. The good and evil of the rational social animal lie not in passivity, but in activity, just as virtue and vice lie not in passivity, but in activity. It is not evil for a thrown stone to come down, nor is it good to have been carried up. Look within the principles that guide people, and you will see who the judges are that you fear, and what kind of judges they are of themselves. Everything is constantly changing, including yourself. You are in a state of continuous mutation and destruction, just like the entire universe. It is your duty to let go of another person's wrongful act. The end of activity, the cessation of movement and opinion, and in a sense, their death, is not evil. Now, think about your life as a child, as a youth, as an adult, and in old age. Every change was a death. Is there anything to fear? Consider your life under your grandfather, your mother, and your father. There were many differences, changes, and endings. Is there anything to fear? Similarly, the termination, cessation, and change of your entire life should not be feared. Examine your own faculty of reason, as well as that of the universe and your neighbor. Make your own faculty just, remember your connection to the universe, and determine whether your neighbor acted ignorantly or with knowledge. Consider that their faculty of reason is similar to yours. Just as you are a part of a social system, let every action you take be a part of social life. Any action that does not contribute to a social end tears your life apart and prevents it from being whole. It is like a mutiny when one person in a popular assembly acts alone and goes against the general agreement. Quarrels of children, their games, and spirits carrying dead bodies - that is everything. The representation of the mansions of the dead makes this clearer. Examine the quality of the form of an object and detach it from its material part. Then contemplate it and determine the natural lifespan of something with this particular form. You have endured countless troubles by not being content with your faculty of reason when it does what it is naturally meant to do. But enough of this. When someone blames or hates you, or when people say hurtful things about you, approach their souls and see what kind of people they are. You will realize that there is no reason to worry about their opinions of you. However, you should still be kind towards them because they are naturally your friends. The gods also help them in various ways, through dreams and signs, to attain what they value. The periodic movements of the universe remain the same, going up and down from age to age. Either the universal intelligence sets itself in motion for every separate effect, and if so, be content with the results of its activity, or it sets itself in motion once and everything else follows in sequence. Alternatively, indivisible elements are the origin of all things. In short, if there is a god, everything is fine. And if chance rules, do not let yourself be governed by it. Soon, the earth will cover us all. Then the earth will also change, along with everything else that results from change. These changes will continue forever, and if a person reflects on the rapidity and succession of these changes, they will despise anything that is perishable. The universal cause is like a winter storm: it carries everything along with it. But how useless are all these poor people who are engaged in political matters, and, as they think, are playing the philosopher! All fools. Well then, man: do what nature now requires. Get moving, if you can, and don't worry about whether anyone will notice; don't expect Plato's Republic either. Just be content if even the smallest thing goes well, and consider that to be no small achievement. After all, who can change people's opinions? And without a change of opinions, what else is there but the enslavement of people who groan while pretending to obey? Now, tell me about Alexander and Philip and Demetrius of Phalerum. They themselves shall judge whether they understood what the common nature required and trained themselves accordingly. But if they acted like heroes in a tragic play, no one has obligated me to imitate them. The work of philosophy is simple and modest. Don't lead me astray with laziness and arrogance. Look down from above on the countless masses of people and their countless ceremonies, and the endlessly varied voyages through storms and calms, and the differences among those who are born, live together, and die. Also consider the lives of those who lived in ancient times, and the lives of those who will live after you, and the lives currently lived among barbarous nations, and how many don't even know your name, and how many will soon forget it, and how those who may be praising you now will soon be criticizing you. Remember that a posthumous name, reputation, or anything else is of no value. Be free from disturbances regarding external matters, and let there be justice in your own actions, that is, let there be movement and action leading to social acts, for that is according to your nature. You can eliminate many useless things that disturb you, as they exist only in your opinion. By comprehending the entire universe in your mind and contemplating the eternity of time, and observing the rapid change of everything, you will gain ample space for yourself. Consider how short the time is from birth to death, and the infinite time before birth as well as the equally boundless time after death. Everything you see will quickly perish, and those who witness its dissolution will also perish soon. Even someone who dies at an extremely old age will be in the same state as someone who dies prematurely. What are these people's guiding principles? What kind of things are they focused on, and why do they love and honor them? Imagine that you can see their poor souls laid bare. When they think that they do harm with their criticism or good with their praise, what a foolish notion! Loss is nothing more than change. But the universal nature delights in change, and all things are now done well in accordance with her, and have been done in the same way for eternity, and will continue to be so forever. So what do you say? That all things have always been and will always be bad, and that no power has ever been found in so many gods to correct these things, and that the world is doomed to eternal evil? The decay of the substance that is the foundation of everything! Water, dust, bones, filth; or again, marble rocks, the calluses of the earth; and gold and silver, the sediments; and garments, just bits of hair; and purple dye, blood; and everything else is of the same kind. And that which is like breath is also another thing of the same kind, changing from one to another. Enough of this miserable life and complaining and monkey-like behavior. Why are you disturbed? What is new about this? What upsets you? Is it the appearance of the thing? Look at it. Or is it the substance? Look at it. But besides these, there is nothing. Finally, be more simple and better towards the gods. It doesn't matter whether we examine these things for a hundred years or three. If any person has done wrong, the harm is their own. But maybe they haven't done wrong. Either all things come from one intelligent source and come together as one entity, and individual parts should not criticize what is done for the benefit of the whole, or there are only atoms and nothing else but mixture and dispersion. So why are you disturbed? Ask your rational mind, are you dead, corrupted, pretending, becoming animalistic, joining the herd and feeding with the rest? 

Either the gods have no power or they do have power. If they have no power, why do you pray to them? But if they do have power, why don't you pray for them to grant you the ability to not fear the things you fear, or not desire the things you desire, or not be pained by anything, instead of praying for these things to not happen or happen? Because surely if they can cooperate with humans, they can cooperate for these purposes. But maybe you'll say that the gods have given you the power. Well, isn't it better to use what is in your power like a free person rather than desiring in a submissive and lowly manner what is not in your power? And who has told you that the gods don't help us even in the things that are within our control? Start praying for such things, and you'll see. 

One person prays like this: How can I sleep with that woman? You should pray like this: How can I not desire to sleep with her? Another person prays like this: How can I be freed from this? Another prays: How can I not desire to be freed? Another prays like this: How can I not lose my child? You should pray like this: How can I not be afraid of losing him/her? In short, redirect your prayers in this way and see what happens. 

Epicurus says, during my illness, I did not talk about my bodily suffering, nor did I discuss such topics with those who visited me. Instead, I continued to talk about the nature of things as before, focusing on how the mind, while experiencing the movements happening in the frail body, can remain free from disturbances and maintain its true good. I also did not give the doctors a chance to appear solemn, as if they were doing something great. My life continued well and happily. So, do the same as he did, both in sickness if you're sick, and in any other circumstances. Never abandon philosophy in any situation that may occur, and don't engage in trivial conversations with ignorant or unenlightened individuals. This is a principle of all schools of philosophy. Instead, focus only on what you are currently doing and the means by which you are doing it. 

When you are offended by someone's shameless behavior, immediately ask yourself, is it possible for shameless people to not exist in the world? It is not possible. So, don't expect the impossible. This person is also one of those shameless individuals who must inevitably exist in the world. Apply the same reasoning to scoundrels, untrustworthy individuals, and anyone who does wrong in any way. By reminding yourself that it is impossible for this kind of person to not exist, you will become more compassionate towards each individual. 

It is also helpful to recognize, when the occasion arises, the virtue that nature has given humans to counteract every wrongful act. For against foolishness, she has given mildness, and against other types of people, she has bestowed different powers. In every case, it is possible for you to correct and teach the person who has gone astray, as every person who makes mistakes has deviated from their intended path. Additionally, how have you been harmed? You will find that none of those who have irritated you have done anything to make your mind worse. The evil and harm that exist are solely rooted in the mind. And what harm is done or what is there strange, if the man who has not been instructed does the acts of an uninstructed man? Consider whether you should not rather blame yourself, because you did not expect such a man to err in such a way. For you had means given to you by your reason to suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error, and yet you have forgotten and are amazed that he has erred. But most of all when you blame a man as faithless or ungrateful, turn to yourself. For the fault is clearly your own, whether you trusted that a man who had such a disposition would keep his promise, or when conferring your kindness you did not confer it unconditionally, nor yet in such a way as to have received from your very act all the profit. For what more do you want when you have done a man a service? Are you not content that you have done something in line with your nature, and do you seek to be paid for it? Just as if the eye demanded a recompense for seeing, or the feet for walking. For as these members are formed for a particular purpose, and by working according to their respective constitutions obtain what is their own, so also as man is formed by nature for acts of benevolence, when he has done anything benevolent or in any other way conducive to the common interest, he has acted in accordance with his constitution, and he gets what is his own.

BOOK TEN

Will you, then, my soul, never be good and simple and one and transparent, more evident than the body which surrounds you? Will you never enjoy an affectionate and contented disposition? Will you never be full and without a want of any kind, longing for nothing more, nor desiring anything, either animate or inanimate, for the enjoyment of pleasures? Nor yet desiring time in which you shall have longer enjoyment, or place, or pleasant climate, or society of people with whom you may live in harmony? But will you be satisfied with your present condition, and pleased with all that is around you, and will you convince yourself that you have everything and that it comes from the gods, that everything is well for you, and will be well whatever shall please them, and whatever they shall give for the preservation of the perfect living being, the good and just and beautiful, which generates and holds together all things, and contains and embraces all things which are dissolved for the production of other like things? Will you never be such that you shall so dwell in community with gods and humans as neither to find fault with them at all, nor to be condemned by them?

Observe what your nature requires, so far as you are governed by nature only: then do it and accept it, if your nature, so far as you are a living being, shall not be made worse by it.

And next you must observe what your nature requires so far as you are a living being. And all this you may allow yourself, if your nature, so far as you are a rational animal, shall not be made worse by it. But the rational animal is consequently also a social animal. Use these rules, then, and trouble yourself about nothing else. Everything which happens either happens in such a way as you are formed by nature to bear it, or as you are not formed by nature to bear it. If, then, it happens to you in such a way as you are formed by nature to bear it, do not complain, but bear it as you are formed by nature to bear it. But if it happens in such a way as you are not formed by nature to bear it, do not complain, for it will perish after it has consumed you. Remember, however, that you are formed by nature to bear everything, with respect to which it depends on your own opinion to make it endurable and tolerable, by thinking that it is either your interest or your duty to do this.

If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and show him his error. But if you are not able, blame yourself, or even do not blame yourself. No matter what happens to you, it was destined to happen from the beginning of time. The causes that led to it have been spinning the thread of your existence and everything that comes with it. Whether the universe is made up of atoms or is a system, the first thing to establish is that I am a part of the whole that is governed by nature. Furthermore, I am closely connected to other beings of the same kind as me. By remembering this, I will not be dissatisfied with anything assigned to me from the whole because nothing can harm a part if it benefits the whole. The whole contains only what is advantageous for it, and while all beings share this common principle, the universe, in addition, cannot be forced to generate anything harmful to itself. Therefore, by keeping in mind that I am a part of such a whole, I will be content with everything that happens. And because I am connected to beings of the same kind as me, I will not act in an unsocial manner. Instead, I will focus on things that align with my nature and direct my efforts towards the common interest, avoiding anything that opposes it. If I live in this way, my life will be happy, just like a citizen who acts in the best interest of their fellow citizens and is content with their assigned role in society.

All parts of the whole, everything that naturally exists in the universe, must inevitably perish. However, this should be understood as undergoing change. If this change is naturally both a negative and necessary for the parts, then the whole would not continue to exist in a good condition since the parts are subject to change and destined to perish in various ways. Did nature itself intend to harm its own parts and make them subject to evil and inevitable downfall? It is unbelievable to think so. But even if we remove the concept of nature as an efficient power and consider these changes as natural, it would still be absurd to be surprised or upset as if something is happening against nature, especially since the dissolution of things occurs by returning to the elements they are composed of. Either the elements disperse from which everything is made, or there is a transformation from solid to earthy and from airy to aerial, so these parts are reintegrated into the universal reason, whether through periodic consumption by fire or eternal cycles of renewal. And do not think that the solid and airy parts have belonged to you since birth. They have only been added recently through food and the air you breathe. It is this newly acquired part that changes, not what your mother gave birth to. But even if this newly acquired part is closely connected to the part that is prone to change, it does not invalidate what has been said.

Once you have embraced the qualities of being good, modest, truthful, rational, calm, and magnanimous, make sure you do not abandon these qualities. If you happen to lose them, quickly regain them. And remember that the term "Rational" was meant to signify a discerning attention to every individual thing and freedom from negligence; and that "Equanimity" is the voluntary acceptance of the things which are assigned to you by the common nature; and that "Magnanimity" is the elevation of the intelligent part above the pleasurable or painful sensations of the body, and above that insignificant thing called fame, and death, and all such things. If you maintain yourself in the possession of these qualities, without desiring to be called by them by others, you will be a different person and will enter into a different life. For to continue to be the same as you have been, and to be torn apart and defiled in such a life, is the behavior of a very foolish man and one overly attached to his life, like those half-devoured fighters with wild beasts, who, even though covered in wounds and blood, still beg to be kept for the following day, despite being exposed to the same claws and bites. Therefore, anchor yourself in the possession of these few qualities: and if you are able to abide in them, abide as if you were transported to certain islands of happiness. But if you perceive that you are falling out of them and not maintaining your hold, boldly retreat to some place where you can maintain them, or even depart from life altogether, not in anger, but with simplicity and freedom and modesty, after accomplishing at least one commendable thing in your life, to have exited it in this manner. 

However, in order to remember these qualities, it will greatly help you if you remember the gods and that they do not wish to be flattered, but rather wish all reasonable beings to be made like themselves. And if you remember that what does the work of a fig tree is a fig tree, and what does the work of a dog is a dog, and what does the work of a bee is a bee, and what does the work of a man is a man.

Distractions, war, astonishment, laziness, and servitude will constantly erode those noble principles of yours. How many things do you imagine without studying nature, and how many do you neglect? But it is your duty to observe and do everything in such a way that, at the same time, your ability to handle circumstances is perfected, your contemplative faculties are exercised, and the confidence that comes from knowledge of each individual thing is maintained without showing it, yet not concealed. For when will you enjoy simplicity, when gravity, and when the knowledge of each individual thing, both its substance and its place in the universe, and how long it is meant to exist, and what it is composed of, and to whom it can belong, and who are able to both give it and take it away?

A spider is proud when it has caught a fly, and another when he has caught a poor hare, and another when he has caught a small fish in a net, and another when he has caught wild boars, and another when he has captured bears, and another when he has conquered Sarmatians. Are these not thieves, if you examine their beliefs?

Acquire the contemplative way of seeing how all things change into one another, and constantly focus on it, and practice this aspect of philosophy. For nothing is so well-suited to cultivate magnanimity. Such a person has shed their attachment to the body, and as they see that they must, no one knows how soon, depart from among humans and leave everything here, they wholeheartedly devote themselves to acting justly in all their actions, and in everything else that happens, they surrender themselves to universal nature. But as for what any person may say or think about them or do against them, they never even consider it, content with these two things: acting justly in what they presently do, and being satisfied with what is presently assigned to them. They set aside all distracting and busy pursuits, and desire nothing else but to fulfill the straight path according to the law, and by fulfilling the straight path, to follow God. Why be suspicious when you have the power to inquire and determine what needs to be done? If you see clearly, proceed confidently without looking back. But if you are unsure, seek advice from trusted advisors. And if you encounter obstacles, act within your abilities while considering what is just. It is best to strive for this goal, and if you fail, let it be in the pursuit of what is right. Those who follow reason are both calm and active, cheerful and composed.

Upon waking, ask yourself whether it truly matters if someone else does what is just and right. It doesn't.

Remember that those who arrogantly praise or criticize others reveal their true nature in their actions. Remember what they do, avoid, and pursue. They steal and rob not with their hands or feet, but with their most valuable asset, which can produce fidelity, modesty, truth, law, and happiness when chosen.

To nature, the giver and taker of all, the wise and humble man says, "Give what you will, take back what you will." And he says this not with pride, but with obedience and contentment.

Your remaining time in life is short. Live as if you were on a mountain. It matters not whether you live here or there, as long as you live in harmony with the world, as a citizen of the universe.

Let people see and know a true man who lives according to nature. If they cannot tolerate him, let them eliminate him. For it is better to die than to live as others do.

No longer discuss the qualities of a good man, but be one.

Contemplate the vastness of time and substance, realizing that individual things are as insignificant as a grain of a fig in substance, and as fleeting as the turning of a gimlet in time.

Observe that everything that exists is in a state of decay, change, putrefaction, or dispersion. Everything is ultimately destined to die.

Consider how men behave when they eat, sleep, reproduce, relieve themselves, and so on. Then consider what kind of men they become when they are arrogant, angry, or scolding from positions of power. Just a short time ago, many of them were slaves. Reflect on what condition they will be in after a little more time.

That which benefits each thing is what universal nature brings to it. And it is beneficial at the time when nature brings it.

The earth loves rain, the sky loves thunderstorms, and the universe loves bringing forth what is meant to be. I say to the universe, I love as you love. And isn't it also said that "this or that is meant to be produced"?

Either you are living here and have become accustomed to it, or you are leaving by your own choice, or you are dying and have fulfilled your duty. Beyond these possibilities, there is nothing else. So be of good cheer.

Always remember that this piece of land is no different from any other. Everything here is the same as things on a mountain or by the seashore, or wherever you choose to be. As Plato said, it's like dwelling within the walls of a city as if in a shepherd's fold on a mountain.

What is the state of my mind now? And how am I using it? And for what purpose? Is it lacking understanding? Is it detached from social life? Is it fused with the physical body, moving in sync with it?

Running away from a master makes one a fugitive. But the law is the true master, and breaking the law makes one a fugitive. Feeling grief, anger, or fear is dissatisfaction because it pertains to something that has been, is, or will be, all of which are determined by the one who governs all things, who is the Law itself, assigning to each person what is appropriate. Those who fear, grieve, or get angry are running away from reality. A man plants a seed in a womb and then leaves, and someone else takes it and works on it to create a child. It's amazing what can come from such simple materials! Similarly, the child consumes food, and another process turns it into perception, motion, life, strength, and other things. It's incredible and strange. Take a moment to observe the hidden ways in which things are produced, just like we can observe the forces that move things up and down without seeing them with our eyes. Always remember that everything that exists now has existed in the past and will exist again. Imagine different scenarios from history, like the courts of Hadrian, Antoninus, Philip, Alexander, and Croesus. These were all like the dramas we see today, just with different actors.

Think of anyone who is upset or discontented as a pig being sacrificed, kicking and screaming. The same goes for someone who silently laments the bonds that hold us. Remember that only rational beings have the ability to choose their reactions, while everyone else is driven by necessity.

Whenever you do something, take a moment to pause and ask yourself if death is truly something to be afraid of because it takes away what you have. When you're offended by someone's mistake, immediately turn to yourself and reflect on your own errors. For example, thinking that money, pleasure, or reputation are good things. By doing this, you'll quickly forget your anger, especially if you consider that the person was compelled to do what they did. If possible, remove that compulsion from them.

When you see someone like Satyron the Socratic, think of others like Eutyches or Hymen. When you see Euphrates, think of Eutychion or Silvanus. When you see Alciphron, think of Tropaeophorus. When you see Xenophon, think of Crito or Severus. And when you look at yourself, think of any other Caesar. Do this with everyone you encounter. Then remind yourself, where are these men now? Nowhere, or nobody knows. By continuously thinking this way, you'll see human things as smoke and nothingness. Especially when you realize that what has changed will never exist again in the infinite span of time. But consider, how short is your own existence? Why aren't you content to live this brief time in an orderly manner? What opportunities for growth and action are you avoiding? These things are all exercises for your reason, as it carefully examines the nature of life. Persevere until you make these things your own, just as a strong stomach makes all things its own, and a blazing fire turns everything that is thrown into it into flame and brightness.

Don't let anyone truthfully claim that you are not genuine or good. Let them be liars if they think anything of the sort about you. This is completely within your control. Who can stop you from being good and genuine? Decide that you won't live unless you are. Because reason doesn't allow you to live if you're not.

What can you do or say about this life that aligns with reason? Whatever it may be, you have the power to do it or say it. Don't make excuses that you're hindered. You won't stop lamenting until your mind is in a state where doing things that align with human nature brings you the same pleasure as luxury brings to those who enjoy it. A person should find enjoyment in everything that is within their power to do according to their own nature. And it is within their power everywhere. However, a cylinder, water, fire, or anything else governed by nature or an irrational soul cannot move freely on its own, as there are many obstacles that hinder them. But intelligence and reason can overcome anything that stands in their way, in the manner in which they are naturally formed and choose to do so. Keep in mind the ease with which reason can navigate through all obstacles, like fire moving upward, a stone falling downward, or a cylinder rolling down a slope, and seek nothing further. Other obstacles only affect the body, which is lifeless, or they only have an impact if the reason itself yields to them through opinion. If they truly caused harm, the person experiencing it would immediately become bad. In the case of all things with a certain constitution, any harm that befalls them makes them worse. But in the same situation, a person becomes better, so to speak, and more deserving of praise by making the right use of these accidents. Lastly, remember that nothing harms a true citizen that does not harm the state, and nothing harms the state that does not harm the law. And none of these so-called misfortunes harm the law. Therefore, what does not harm the law does not harm the state or its citizens.

To someone who truly understands these principles, even the shortest piece of advice is enough to remind them to be free from grief and fear. For example, leaves are scattered on the ground by the wind, just like the race of men. Your children are also like leaves, as are those who either praise or criticize you, or those who will pass on your fame to future generations. All these things are produced in the spring, as the poet says, then the wind blows them down, and the forest produces new leaves in their place. But a brief existence is common to all things, yet you avoid or pursue everything as if it will last forever. In a short time, you will close your eyes, and someone else will soon mourn the one who accompanied you to your grave.

A healthy eye should be able to see all visible things without desiring only green things, as that is the condition of a diseased eye. Similarly, a healthy sense of hearing and smell should be ready to perceive everything that can be heard and smelled. A healthy stomach should approach all food the way a mill approaches everything it grinds. And likewise, a healthy mind should be prepared for everything that happens, without wishing for others to live or for everyone to praise their actions.

No person is so fortunate that there won't be someone pleased with their impending death when they pass away. Even if they were a good and wise person, someone will eventually say, "Let us finally breathe freely, relieved from this teacher." It's true that they were not harsh to any of us, but I sensed their silent judgment of us. This is what people say about a good person. But in our own case, there are many other reasons why people would want to be rid of us. You should consider this when you are dying, and you will depart more content by reflecting on this: I am leaving behind a life in which even my associates, for whom I have worked so hard, prayed, and cared, themselves want me to leave, hoping to gain some advantage from it. So why should a man cling to staying here any longer? However, do not leave with ill feelings towards them, but maintain your own character, and be friendly, kind, benevolent, and mild. Depart from men as if you were peacefully passing away, just as a soul easily separates from the body in a quiet death. Nature united you to them and associated you, but does it now dissolve that union? Well, I am separated from them as if from kinsmen, but not forcefully. This too is in accordance with nature.

Whenever someone does something, try to inquire with yourself: What is this person's intention? But start with yourself and examine your own intentions first. Remember that the power that motivates and controls you is hidden within you. This is the power of persuasion, this is life, this is, if you will, what defines a person. When contemplating yourself, do not include the vessel that surrounds you and the instruments attached to it. They are like tools, only different in that they are connected to the body. Without the cause that moves and controls them, these parts are useless, much like a weaver's shuttle, a writer's pen, or a driver's whip.

BOOK ELEVEN

These are the qualities of the rational soul: it can observe itself, analyze itself, and shape itself as it desires. It enjoys the fruits it produces, just as plants bear fruits that others enjoy, or as animals have something within them that corresponds to fruits. It achieves its own purpose, regardless of how long its life may be. Unlike a dance or a play or similar things, where the entire action is incomplete if it is cut short, the rational soul completes and fulfills every part and every moment of its existence. It can say, "I have what is truly mine." Furthermore, it traverses the entire universe, including the surrounding empty space. It surveys its form and extends itself into the infinity of time. It comprehends and embraces the cyclical renewal of all things. It understands that those who come after us will not see anything new, just as those who came before us didn't see anything more. In a way, someone who is forty years old, if they have any understanding at all, has seen everything that has been and will be, thanks to the uniformity that pervades all things. Another quality of the rational soul is love for one's neighbor, as well as truth, modesty, and valuing nothing more than itself. These qualities are also inherent in the concept of Law. Therefore, right reason is no different from the reason of justice.

You will not value pleasing songs, dancing, or the pancratium if you break down the melody of the voice into its individual sounds and ask yourself if you are controlled by each one. You will be too ashamed to admit it. Apply the same approach to dancing and the pancratium. In all things, except for virtue and virtuous actions, focus on their individual parts and through this division, come to value them less. Apply this rule to your entire life as well.

What a soul it is that is prepared, if at any moment it must be separated from the body, to either be extinguished, dispersed, or continue to exist. This readiness must come from a person's own judgment, not from mere obstinacy, like with the Christians, but with careful consideration, dignity, and the ability to persuade others, without any dramatic display.

Have I done something for the common good? Well then, I have received my reward. Always keep this in mind and never stop doing good. What is your purpose? To be good. And how can you achieve this? By following general principles, some related to the nature of the universe and others concerning the proper constitution of humanity.

Tragedies were initially introduced on stage to remind people of the inevitable occurrences in life and to teach that if you find pleasure in the performance, you shouldn't be troubled by what happens in reality. These events are bound to happen, and even those who cry out in despair must endure them. Some profound statements have been made by dramatic writers, such as "If the gods neglect me and my children, there is a reason for it" and "We must not be upset by what happens in life; instead, we should reap its fruits like a bountiful harvest of wheat."

After tragedy, old comedy emerged, which boldly addressed issues of insolence, serving as a warning to people. Even Diogenes drew inspiration from these writers to caution against arrogance. Then came the middle comedy, which had its own characteristics, followed by the new comedy, which gradually became more focused on artificiality. While some valuable insights can be found in the works of these writers, the overall purpose and direction of such poetry and drama is questionable.

It is evident that there is no better condition for philosophical contemplation than the one you find yourself in now.

Just as a branch cut off from a tree is disconnected from the whole, when a person separates themselves from others, they detach themselves from the entire social community. While someone else may physically sever a branch, a person severs themselves from their neighbor through their own actions and hatred. They may not realize that they have also disconnected themselves from the entire social system. However, Zeus, who established society, allows us the opportunity to reconnect with what is near and regain our role in the whole. Nevertheless, if this type of separation occurs frequently, it becomes challenging to reintegrate and restore the previous harmony. Ultimately, a branch that grew together with the tree from the beginning and shared its life is fundamentally different from one that was cut off and then grafted back on. It is similar to what gardeners mean when they say that it grows with the rest of the tree but does not possess the same essence.

Just as those who try to obstruct your path when you act in accordance with reason cannot sway you from your course of action, do not let them hinder your compassionate feelings towards them. Be equally vigilant in both aspects: maintaining sound judgment and action, as well as displaying gentleness towards those who attempt to impede or trouble you. It is a weakness to be angered by them or to be diverted from your purpose out of fear. Both actions are a betrayal of your duty, whether it is driven by fear or a detachment from your natural kinship and friendship.

There is no nature that is inferior to art, as art imitates the nature of things. Therefore, if this is true, the most perfect and comprehensive nature of all cannot be inferior to the skill of art. All arts serve the lesser for the sake of the greater, and the universal nature does the same. In fact, justice originates from this principle, and the other virtues are built upon it. Justice cannot be upheld if we prioritize indifferent matters or if we are easily deceived, careless, and fickle. If things don't come to you, the things you pursue and avoid that disturb you, you should still approach them in a certain way. Let your judgment about them be at ease, and they will remain calm, and you won't be seen as someone who is actively seeking or avoiding them.

The soul's spherical form maintains its shape when it is not reaching out towards anything, nor turning inward, nor scattered, nor sinking down, but rather illuminated by light, which allows it to see the truth - the truth of all things and the truth within itself.

If someone despises me, they can deal with that themselves. But I will focus on making sure I don't do or say anything that deserves contempt. If someone hates me, they can deal with it. But I will be kind and benevolent towards everyone, and willing to gently point out their mistakes, not in a reproachful manner or as a display of my endurance, but nobly and honestly, like the great Phocion, unless, of course, he was only pretending. Because our inner selves should be such that the gods see us as neither dissatisfied nor complaining. After all, what harm is it to you if you are currently doing what is in line with your own nature and satisfied with what is suitable to the nature of the universe at this moment, since you are a human being placed in your position to contribute to the common good in some way?

People despise and flatter each other, and people want to elevate themselves above others and submit to others. How insincere and false is the person who says, "I have decided to treat you fairly." What are you doing, man? There's no need to announce it. Your actions will speak for themselves soon enough. The true nature of a person should be clearly visible in their eyes, just as someone who is loved can read everything in the eyes of their beloved. A good and honest person should be as noticeable as a strong smell, so that anyone nearby can smell it whether they want to or not. But pretending to be simple is like a crooked stick. Nothing is more disgraceful than a false friendship. Avoid it above all else. The good, simple, and kind show all these things in their eyes, and there is no mistaking it.

As for living the best way, the power lies within the soul if it remains indifferent to things that are indifferent. And it will remain indifferent if it considers each of these things separately and as a whole, and if it remembers that none of these things create opinions about themselves or come to us. Instead, these things remain unchanged, and it is us who form judgments about them and, so to speak, write them within ourselves. And it is within our power to choose not to write them or, if these judgments have somehow made their way into our minds, to erase them. And if we also remember that this attention will only be temporary, and that life will eventually come to an end. Besides, what trouble is there in doing this? If these things are in accordance with nature, rejoice in them, and they will be easy for you. But if they go against nature, seek what aligns with your own nature and strive towards it, even if it brings no recognition. Because every person is allowed to seek their own good.

Consider where each thing comes from, what it consists of, how it changes, and what it will become once it has changed, and that it will not cause any harm.

If anyone has wronged you, first consider your relationship to others and that we are made for one another. In another sense, I was made to be in charge of them, like a ram over a flock or a bull over a herd. But examine the matter from its fundamental principles: if everything is not just atoms, then it is nature that organizes everything. If that's the case, inferior things exist for the sake of superior things, and these exist for the sake of one another. Secondly, think about the kind of men they are in various aspects of their lives - at the dinner table, in bed, and so on. Pay attention to the opinions that compel them and consider the pride with which they carry out their actions.

Thirdly, if men are doing the right thing, we should not be displeased. However, if they are not acting rightly, it is clear that they do so unknowingly and out of ignorance. Just as every soul is unwillingly deprived of the truth, it is also unwillingly deprived of the ability to treat others according to their merits. Therefore, men feel pain when they are labeled as unjust, ungrateful, greedy, or any other kind of wrongdoer to their neighbors.

Fourthly, recognize that you, too, make mistakes and that you are just a human being like everyone else. Even if you manage to avoid certain faults, you still have the inclination to commit them. Perhaps you abstain from these faults due to fear, concern for your reputation, or some other selfish motive.

Fifthly, acknowledge that you may not even understand whether others are truly doing wrong or not, as many actions are influenced by specific circumstances. In short, one must acquire substantial knowledge in order to make accurate judgments about the actions of others.

Sixthly, when you find yourself greatly vexed or saddened, remember that life is fleeting, and before long, we will all be dead.

Seventhly, it is not the actions of others that disturb us, as those actions are based on their own guiding principles. Instead, it is our own opinions that cause us distress. Therefore, by letting go of these opinions and treating judgments about others' actions as insignificant, we can eliminate our anger. But how can we let go of these opinions? By realizing that another person's wrongful act does not bring shame upon you. If only actions that are shameful were considered bad, then you, too, would inevitably commit many wrongs and become a thief or worse.

Eighthly, consider that the pain caused by anger and vexation towards others' actions far outweighs the pain caused by the actions themselves.

Ninthly, understand that a genuinely good disposition is invincible. No matter how violent a person may be, if you maintain a kind disposition towards them, gently admonish them when the opportunity arises, and calmly correct their errors, what harm can they truly do to you? Remind them, with gentle tact and through general principles, that their actions go against the natural order, even bees and other naturally social animals do not behave as they do. Approach this without any hidden motives or reproach, but with affection and without any bitterness in your heart. Do not lecture them or seek admiration from bystanders. You can do this when they are alone or even when others are present...

Remember these nine principles as if they were a gift from the Muses and finally begin to truly live as a human being. However, be careful to avoid flattery or disdain towards others, as both behaviors are antisocial and lead to harm. Keep in mind that in moments of anger, being driven by passion is not a sign of true manhood. Mildness and gentleness, on the other hand, are more in line with human nature and demonstrate true strength. The person who possesses these qualities has strength, resilience, and courage, not the one who is prone to fits of anger and discontent. Just as the more free a person's mind is from all passions, the stronger they become. Pain is a sign of weakness, just as anger is. Those who succumb to pain or anger are both wounded and submissive.

And, if you so wish, accept a tenth gift from the leader of the Muses, Apollo. It is this - expecting bad people not to do wrong is madness, for anyone who expects this desires the impossible. But allowing men to treat others in such a way, and expecting them not to harm you, is irrational and tyrannical. There are four main errors of the superior faculty that you must always be cautious of, and once you recognize them, you should eliminate them and say to yourself: this thought is unnecessary; this thought destroys social unity; this thought does not come from my true thoughts, for it is absurd for a man not to speak from his true thoughts. However, the fourth error is when you blame yourself for something, as this is evidence that your divine part is being overpowered and yielding to the less honorable and perishable part, the body, and its base pleasures.

Your celestial part and all the fiery parts within you, although they naturally tend upward, are overpowered here in the physical body. And even the earthy and watery parts within you, although they naturally tend downward, are lifted and occupy a position that is not their natural one. In this way, the elemental parts obey the universal order, for once they have been fixed in a place, they remain there until the universal order signals for their dissolution. Isn't it strange, then, that your rational part alone disobeys and is dissatisfied with its own place? And yet, no external force is imposed upon it, only those things that are in accordance with its nature. Still, it does not submit, but instead moves in the opposite direction. For the inclination towards injustice, intemperance, anger, grief, and fear is nothing more than deviating from nature. And when the ruling faculty is discontent with what happens, it abandons its proper role, as it is meant to be devoted to piety, reverence towards the gods, and justice. These qualities are all part of contentment with the natural order of things and are even more important than acts of justice.

A person who does not have a consistent and meaningful purpose in life cannot remain consistent and true to themselves. However, it is not enough to simply have a purpose; it is important to determine what that purpose should be. Just as there is no unanimous agreement on what is considered good, but only on certain things that concern the common interest, we should also set for ourselves a common and social-political purpose. By directing all our efforts towards this purpose, we will ensure that our actions are consistent and that we remain true to ourselves.

Think about the country mouse and the city mouse, and the fear and anxiety of the city mouse.

Socrates used to refer to the opinions of the majority as "Lamiae," which are meant to scare children.

The Spartans would reserve shaded seats for strangers at their public events, while they themselves would sit anywhere.

When Socrates declined Perdiccas' invitation, he explained, "It is because I would not want to receive a favor and then be unable to return it, which would be the worst possible outcome."

The Ephesians had a teaching that encouraged them to constantly think of virtuous individuals from the past.

The Pythagoreans advised us to look at the heavens in the morning to remind ourselves of the celestial bodies that consistently and flawlessly perform their duties and to be reminded of their purity and nakedness, as stars are not veiled.

Consider how Socrates dressed himself in a simple garment after his wife, Xanthippe, took his cloak and left. Think about what Socrates said to his friends who were ashamed of him and distanced themselves when they saw him dressed in such a manner.

You cannot establish rules for others in writing or reading until you have learned to obey rules yourself. This is even more true in life. You're a slave: free speech isn't for you. And my heart laughed. People will curse virtue, speaking harshly. Looking for a fig in winter is insane, just like looking for a child when it's no longer allowed. When a man kisses his child, Epictetus said, he should whisper to himself, "Tomorrow you might die." But those are bad omens. "No word is a bad omen," said Epictetus, "if it expresses any natural work; or if it is, then it's also a bad omen to talk about corn being harvested." The unripe grape, the ripe bunch, the dried grape, they all change into something that doesn't exist yet. No one can take away our free will. Epictetus also said that a man must learn an art or rules for giving his consent; and in his actions, he must be careful to consider circumstances, social interests, and the value of the object. He should completely stay away from sensual desire, and he should not show aversion to anything that's not within our control. So, the argument is not about something ordinary, but about being mad or not. Socrates used to ask, "What do you want? Rational or irrational souls?" "Rational souls," they would answer. "What kind of rational souls?" he would ask. "Sound ones," they would reply. "Then why don't you seek them?" he would question. "Because we already have them," they would say. "Then why do you fight and argue?" he would ask. 

Book Twelve:
All the things you want to achieve through a long and winding path, you can have now if you don't deny them to yourself. This means that if you ignore the past, trust in the future, and only focus on living in accordance with piety and justice in the present. Live in accordance with piety, so that you can be content with the circumstances assigned to you, as nature intended it for you and you for it. Live in accordance with justice, so that you always speak the truth openly and honestly, and do what is right according to laws and the worth of each situation. Don't let another person's wickedness, opinions, voices, or even the sensations of your own physical body distract you from this. The passive part of you will take care of those things. So, if when the time comes for you to depart, you neglect everything else and only respect your ruling faculty and the divinity within you, and if you fear not because you will eventually cease to live, but because you fear never having lived according to nature, then you will be a person worthy of the universe that created you. You will no longer be a stranger in your own land, and you won't be surprised by daily occurrences or dependent on external things like clothing, housing, and fame. God sees the minds of all people, stripped of their material bodies and impurities. With his intellectual part alone, he touches the intelligence that flows from himself into these bodies. If you also do this, you will rid yourself of much trouble. Those who don't care about their physical bodies won't bother themselves with clothes, dwelling, fame, or other external displays. You are composed of three things: a small body, a little breath (life), and intelligence. The first two are your responsibility to take care of, but the third is truly yours. So if you separate yourself from others' opinions and actions, as well as your own, and let go of future worries and external circumstances, you can live a pure and free life. Just do what is right, accept what happens, and speak the truth. If you detach yourself from the senses and the past and future, and focus on the present moment, you can live the rest of your life without disturbances, with dignity, and in accordance with your inner divinity.

I've always wondered why people value the opinions of others more than their own. If a god or wise teacher told someone to think and express only what they truly believe, they couldn't handle it. We care more about what others think of us than what we think of ourselves.

How is it that the gods, who have arranged everything for the benefit of mankind, have overlooked the fact that good and religious people, who have had the closest connection with the divine, simply cease to exist after death? But if that's how it is, then it must be what was meant to be. If it were just and natural for them to continue existing, it would have happened. But since it hasn't, we must accept that it shouldn't have.

Practice even the things you think you can't do. Even though the left hand is usually weaker, it can hold the reins more firmly because it has practiced doing so.

Consider the state of your body and soul when you die, the brevity of life, the vastness of time, the fragility of everything. Reflect on the essence of things, the reasons behind actions, the nature of pain, pleasure, death, and fame. Understand that you are the cause of your own discomfort and that no one else can hinder you. Everything is a matter of perspective.

Apply your principles like a pancratiast, not a gladiator. The gladiator drops his sword and gets killed, but the pancratiast always has his hand to defend himself.

Look at things for what they truly are, separating them into their material, form, and purpose.

Realize the power you have to only do what aligns with God's will and to accept everything that God gives you.

When it comes to things that happen naturally, we shouldn't blame the gods or humans, as they don't do wrong intentionally. We should therefore avoid blaming anyone. How ridiculous and strange it is for someone to be surprised by anything that happens in life! There are only three possibilities: there is a predetermined fate and order, or there is a benevolent higher power, or there is just chaos without purpose or direction. So, if there is an inevitable fate, why resist it? But if there is a higher power that can be appeased, then strive to be deserving of its help. And if there is simply chaos without a governing force, find solace in knowing that you possess an intelligence that can guide you through any storm. Even if the storm carries away your physical body and everything else, it cannot take away your intelligence. Just like a lamp continues to shine until it is extinguished, the truth, justice, and temperance within you should not be extinguished before your death.

When someone appears to have done wrong, ask yourself, "How do I know if this is truly a wrongful act?" And even if they have done wrong, how do I know they haven't already condemned themselves? It is like tearing their own face. Remember that the person who doesn't want a bad person to do wrong is like someone who doesn't want a fig tree to produce figs, infants to cry, or a horse to neigh - these things are necessary. So, what should a person with such a character do? If you are easily angered, work on changing your disposition.

If it is not right, don't do it. If it is not true, don't say it. Always observe what causes certain appearances for you and break it down into its form, material, purpose, and timeframe. Finally, realize that you have something within you that is better and more divine than the external forces that try to control you. What is currently on your mind? Is it fear, suspicion, desire, or something else?

First, don't act without thought or purpose. Second, make sure your actions are aligned with a greater social purpose.

Remember that soon you will be nothing and nowhere, and none of the things you see now will exist, nor will the people living today. Everything is meant to change and perish so that new things can come into existence.

Understand that everything is just opinion, and opinions are within your control. You can choose to remove your opinion whenever you want, just like a sailor who reaches a calm bay after passing a promontory.

When any activity comes to its natural end, it suffers no harm because it has ceased. Similarly, if our entire life comes to an end at the right time, it is not a bad thing that it has ended. The timing and duration of life are determined by nature - sometimes by the individual's nature, like in old age, but always by the universal nature, which ensures the continuous renewal and perfection of the whole universe. Anything that benefits the universal is inherently good and timely. Therefore, the end of life for any individual is not a bad thing because it is not only beyond our control but also aligns with the greater good. In this way, we are in harmony with the divine, being moved in the same manner and towards the same things as the deity.

Remember these three principles: when you act, do so with the same fairness as justice itself; when faced with external events, understand that they are either random or part of a greater plan, and do not blame chance or accuse a higher power. Secondly, think about the nature of every living being, from its inception to the moment it receives a soul, and from the moment it receives a soul to the moment it returns it. Consider what makes up each being and how it eventually breaks down into its constituent parts. 

Thirdly, imagine if you were suddenly lifted above the earth and looked down upon human affairs. Take note of the vast diversity of these affairs, as well as the multitude of beings that inhabit the air and the heavens. Each time you are raised up, you would witness the same things - the same forms and the same fleeting nature. Is there anything to be proud of in these things? 

Abandon your opinions, and you will be saved. What is stopping you from letting go of them? 

When you find yourself troubled by something, remember that everything happens according to the universal nature. Remember that another person's wrongful actions have no impact on you. Furthermore, remember that everything that happens has always happened and will always happen, everywhere. Remember also the deep connection between every individual and the entire human race. We are all part of a community, not just through shared blood or lineage, but through our shared intelligence. 

Do not forget that every person's intelligence is divine and a manifestation of the deity. Do not forget that nothing truly belongs to a person - their children, their body, and even their soul all come from the divine. Do not forget that everything is subjective perception. Finally, do not forget that each person only lives in the present moment and loses only that. 

Always remember those who have complained bitterly about something, those who have been renowned for their fame or misfortunes, their enemies or their fortunes. Consider where they are now - nothing more than smoke, ashes, and forgotten tales. Also, recall the lives of Fabius Catullinus in the countryside, Lucius Lupus in his gardens, Stertinius in Baiae, Tiberius in Capreae, and Rufus in Velia. Reflect on the futile pursuit of anything accompanied by pride and how worthless everything becomes after which people desperately strive. It is far more philosophical for a person to seize the opportunities presented to them and embrace the present moment. 

THE END
